151201,d,I,S,,,,1a,I maximized A by moving the slider all the way to the right,
,,I,S,,,,1b,The example showed that moving the slider more to the right resulted in greater A,
,,I,,,,,2a,I tried to maximize A by moving both levels all the way to the right,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"The example showed that when both levers were at 10, the level of A was greatest",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I maximized all levers so that the level of A would be greatest,
,,I,S,,,,3b,The examples showed that maximizing all three levers resulted in the greatest level of A,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I tried to maximize both A & B,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"This position on the lever resulted in the greatest combined amount of A & B. I valued A and B equally, so I looked for the position that would result in the greatest combined amount of both",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I tried to maximize A & B (combined) ,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"I knew that I was judged by levels of A and B, so I chose the lever position that would result in the greatest combined level of both. I sacrificed some A to increase the level of B",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,I tried to increase A while keeping B as high as I could by increasing A in periods 1 + 2 and cutting it in period 3. This preserved B the most,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"I noticed that cutting A in the third period helped preserve more B, so I maximized A in the first two periods but cut some in the third so that B would be as high as I could keep it",
,,I,,,C,,7a,I tried to get A higher without decreasing B or C by much,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"I noticed that increasing A meant sacrificing B and C, but I could increase A a little while sacrificing some B and C.  Though 3 wasn't an example option, I predicted it would result in an acceptable level of A while B and C were still fairly high",
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I tried to maximize A, B and C by making shifts that would sacrifice any level the least",
,,I,,,C,,8b,I realized that a lower input of A initially (1st period) did not sacrifice the ending level of A much while it increased my level of B and C.  I could increase the level of A in the 2nd period to increase my ending level of A without sacrificing much B or C,
,,I,,,C,,9a,I tried to keep all three (ABC) as high as I could with any move of the lever,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,"I saw that choosing a lower value of A for period 1 meant C would be higher, so I chose a lower 1st period A input.  Then I increased A in period 2 and 3 so that my ending level of A would be greater but this meant that I had to sacrifice some b. The end option maximized A and C while sacrificing B",
151202,a,I,S,,,,1a,The goal was to maximize the economic benefit. There was no other stated goal for this task. So I maximized the economic benefit by sliding the bar to the right until the benefit was as high as it could go.,
,,,,,,,1b,I used this strategy because I was instructed to maximize the benefit. There were no instructions to provide balance.,
,,,S,,,,2a,The instructions were to maximize the economic benefits so I moved the sliders to do that.,
,,,S,,,,2b,"As there was only one graph, economic benefits, and only one stated goal, to maximize the economic benefits, I adjusted the bars all the way to maximize the benefits.",
,,,S,,,,3a,"Again, the only goal was to maximize the economic benefits. All 3 sliders were moved to the right as that did achieve maximum economic benefits.",
,,,S,,,,3b,"I used this strategy as there was only one stated goal, to maximize the benefits. The only way to do that was to produce as much as possible. ",
,,I,S,,T,,4a,I wanted to find the point in which the water quality would begin to degrade rapidly and stop that from happening. I found the spot where .1 more would take the lake from healthy to unhealthy rapidly and there was an extreme drop in the quality of the water.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,I used this strategy to provide the healthiest water possible to continue the ecosystem's health state with as little impact as possible from the factory. More profits would have meant a very unhealthy lake. Once you go past the point I selected you may as well maximize profits as the lake would be dead. I chose life.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to ensure that the lake remained healthy (it was ~75%) and have the roughly the same economic benefits over the course of the 100 years.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I wanted to make sure the lake remained as healthy as possible while ensuring that the town received economic benefits that did not decrease over time.,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to find a balance where the lake would remain as healthy as possible and the economic benefits would increase over time. I started out with less economic benefits and they increased but it seemed to allow for more pollution into the lake with less impact as time went on.,
,,I,,,C,,6b,I wanted to make sure that the town had use of the healthiest lake possible while giving them the opportunity for their factory to produce more over time so that their economy could grow.,
,,I,S,,T,,7a,I wanted to find the point in which the water quality remained the best I could get with the most reliability and the most economic profits. I increased the slider by .1 to see where a drastic change occurred and knew that I had found the balance point.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,I used this strategy so that we would have the healthiest lake that would reliably continue to be healthy while maximizing the profits for the town.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,I first found the optimal balance for the first 50 years. I then added in the second 50 but needed to adjust the first year down so that the lake remained healthy and economic benefits did not decrease.,
,,I,S,,T,,8b,"I wanted to ensure that economic benefits did not decrease and they even increased a very small amount while ensuring that the lake was going to as reliably as possible remain healthy. There was a sudden drop off in benefits, health, and reliability which let me see this point.",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,I found the point that was best for the first 1/3. I added in the second at the same point and then had to step back the 1st to get the 3 factors back to an acceptable level. I then added in the 3rd at the same level as the 2nd 1/3 and adjusted the 1st and 2nd years until I found a good balance point for all factors.,
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I wanted to make sure the healthy of the lake, the economic benefits and the reliability of them all stayed as high as possible. I also wanted to ensure that the economic benefits did not decline over time. ",
151203,c,I,S,,,,1a,I maximized the amount of A by moving the slider all the way up.,
,,I,,,,,1b,I figured that the slider corresponded to the amount of A produced.,
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to maximize the amount A. So I checked if moving the slider up correlated with an increase in A in both parts.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"The amount of A went up when I moved the slider up, so I figured that the slider corresponded to the amount of A produced in both parts.",
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to maximize the amount of A produced. So I started with the first slider and checked to see if A increased as I moved it up. I repeated this strategy with the second and third sliders,
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used it because A increased as I moved each slider all the way up.,
,,I,,,S,,4a,I was trying to maximize both A and B. But increasing one led to a decrease in the other. I chose to maximize A and get some B.,
,,I,,,S,,4b,I think I chose to maximize A over B.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to maximize the amount of A and B by moving the sliders. I tried to maximize both with the first slider and then see if I could make it better with the second slider.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I felt that any more movement of the second slider would decrease the optimal amount of B while keeping A the same.,
,,I,S,,,,6a,"I maximized B with the first slider, then I moved the second slider at different intervals to see the effect, and did the same with the third slider.",
,,I,,,,,6b,I think I saw that movement of the sliders in either direction would not be beneficial for either A or B.,
,,I,,,T,,7a,"I tried to maximize all three. I moved the slider over and saw the effect. Once I reached a point where B and C were high, and any further movement of the slider caused A to go higher but causing B and C to plummet I stopped.",
,,I,,,S,,7b,"I felt that maximizing two objectives was better than maximizing only one, ",
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I wsa trying to maximize A, B, and C. I moved the first slider to a point where I thought they were all maximized, then I did the same thing with the second slider,",
,,I,,,S,,8b,It seemed to me that I could not move the sliders  without drastically affecting one of the objectives. Again I tried to get the most out of B and C because I felt that maximizing two objectives was better than only one.,
,,I,S,,T,,9a,"I moved the first slider to maximize all the three together, then I moved the other sliders to accomplish the same goal. As soon as I saw a drastic change in moving the slider I stopped and returned it to the previous setting.",
,,I,,,S,,9b,"I wanted to maximize all three, but felt that getting really high values for B and C was best. Two objectives optimized is better than only one.",
151204,b,I,,O,C,,1a,trying to balance between economic benefit and the health of the lake,
,,I,,O,S,,1b,"I tried to not to fully maximize the economic benefit, but try to favor it over the health of the lake",
,,I,S,,,,2a,optimize the economic benefits,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"according the examples provided, the more waste is produced in the first 50 years in causes more economic benefits than if  more waste is produced in the second 50 years ",
,,I,S,,,,3a,optimize the economic benefits ( find the best way to get  economic benefits 50% over the bar),
,,I,,,,,3b,"According to the example, the best way to optimize the economic benefits is to produce more during the first 33 years if the amount of the waste is produced in the second 33 years is constant. so I chose to maximize the production of the waste in the first 33 years and production no waste during the last 33 years",
,,I,,,C,,4a,balance the amount of waste produced and the health of the lake,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"The quality of the lake drop significantly if the amount of waste produced per year changes from 0.02 to 0.03, but the economic benefit only increase a small amount. so I chose to produce 0.02 wastes per year",
,,I,,,C,,5a,Balance the amount of waste produced and the health of the lake,
,,I,,,C,,5b,Balance the amount of waste produced and the health of the lake,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,Favor the amount of waste produced in the first 33 years than the  amount of waste produced during last 33 years. This way can maximize the economic benefit while keeping the lake healthy,
,,I,,,C,,6b,Balance between the amount of waste produced and the health of the lake,
,,I,S,,T,,7a,the reliability drop significantly from 0.02 to 0.03. I chose 0.02,
,,I,,,C,,7b,trying the find a balance,
,,I,,,,,8a,trying to find the amount of wastes produced that make the dot located at the center of the graph,
,,I,,,C,,8b,trying to balance all 3 conditions,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,I used the graph that maximize the water quality and the economic benefit. Then i just decrease the amount of waste to increase reliability,
,,I,,,C,,9b,Balance all three conditions,
151205,b,I,,O,C,,1a,I sas trying to maximize the amount of economic benefit while trying not to pollute too much.,
,,I,,,,,1b,I saw the differences in the benefits and tried to figure out one possible allocation to match best with the differences.,
,,I,,Sd,,,2a,Tried to maximize the amount of benefit by balancing between the 2 levers.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"I found that when using a higher number for the first lever, there was more benefit later rather than doing it the opposite way.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3a,"I used 0.07,0.07, and 0.03 to minimize pollution and maximize economic benefit.",
,,I,,,,,3b,This strategy seemed to work because there will be more than 50% economic benefit for years to come.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,Trying to find a balance between both factors.,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I think using 0.05 was best because it balanced the priorities out of both factors.,
,,,S,,,,5a,I used 0.03 and 0.07 because I observed the results of 0.05 and 0.07 in the example.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I think this strategy provides optimal economic benefit while still providing optimal quality of water.,
,,I,S,,,,6a,Choosing more waste earlier on in the 100 year span creates more economic benefit in the long run.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I used this strategy to help optimize both factors. I chose this by observing the examples.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I was trying to optimize 3 factors. 0.02 provides a lot of reliability while 0.05 does not.,
,,I,,Sd,C,,7b,I used 0.035 since it was the average of both numbers hoping to create a balance.,
,,,S,,,,8a,I observed the example of choosing 0.02 and 0.05 and how it affected each variable.,
,,I,,,C,,8b,"Therefore, I chose 0.04 and 0.05 because all factors seemed to be close to their almost while also providing reliability.",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"0.03, 0.03, and 0.07 provided little variability. I was looking to optimize all 3 variables.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,I chose numbers that I thought would optimize all 3 variables by choosing the highest number for the middle sector of years based on my observations of the examples.,
151206,a,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to balance waste emission with economic benefit.,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,Keeping the lake clean is also important so I wanted to make sure not to pollute too much and too heavily favor the factory economics.,
,,I,,O,C,,2a,I was trying to limit waste produced while also allowing for economic benefits and providing steady jobs and pay by equalizing waste across the two time periods.,
,,I,,O,C,,2b,I wanted to maximize job and profit stability while still trying to minimize pollution.,
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to maximize economic benefit.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,There was a larger economic benefit to releasing more waste in the first time period that the later two. I then balanced the later two periods until I had maximized economic benefit.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I tried to maximize both water quality and economic benefit.,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I wanted to make sure that I didn't harm the lake but also allowed for the largest profit while protecting the water quality.,
,,I,,,T,,5a,Again I tried to maximize water quality and economic benefit.  I could get more economic benefit but at a great decrease in water quality.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I wanted to protect the lake while making a profit.,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I tried to maximize water quality and economic benefit.,
,,I,S,,T,,6b,"I did this to preserve the lake while also allowing for stable economic benefit.  If more waster were to be released during any of the time periods, a large decrease in water quality would follow.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,I tried to maximize reliability and economic benefit.,
,,I,,,,,7b,I wanted to make sure not to cause irreparable harm to the lake.,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I tried to maximize water quality, economic benefit but most importantly reliability.",
,,I,,,,,8b,I wanted to be sure that algae did not take over the lake and damage it irreparably.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,I tried to maximize reliability at all costs while trying to also maximize economic benefit and water quality.,
,,I,,,,,9b,It was most important to make sure the lake doesn't get overrun with algae but I also tried to keep the other factors in mind.,
151207,c,,S,,,,1a,"Set the total amount of output as high as possible, which equals 10.",
,,P,S,,,,1b,Because the award is positively related to the amount of A.,
,,,S,,,,2a,"Set the total as high as possible, which is 10 in this case.",
,,P,S,,,,2b,"Because the higher the total output, the higher award I get.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,Make the total amount of A generated as many as possible.,
,,P,S,,,,3b,"Because the greater amount of A generated, the greater the award.",
,,I,S,,,,4a,Make as many A as possible while avoiding making too little B.,
,,I,S,,,,4b,"Because more A leads to less B, which is also part of the performance metrics.",
,,I,S,,,,5a,Make as many A as possible.,
,,I,,,S,,5b,"Because it is hard to keep B at a high level without sacrificing a lot of A. Since A and B are both performance metrics, I will make sure there is sufficient A because the output level of B doesn't really make much difference.",
,,I,S,,,,6a,Make as many A as possible while keeping B at an acceptable level.,
,,I,S,,,,6b,"The amount of B doesn't vary much in the high amounts of A, so I will just make decent amount of A and keep B at an acceptable level.",
,,I,S,,S,,7a,Make fewer A so there are as many B and C as possible.,
,,I,S,,S,,7b,"Because A decreases both B and C, I decide to make fewer A so that both B and C will be greater. 2 wins over 1.",
,,I,S,,S,,8a,Make fewer A to get more B and C.,
,,I,S,,S,,8b,There is a tradeoff between A and B/C. 2 beats 1 so I will make as many B and C as possible by decreasing the amount of A.,
,,I,S,,S,,9a,Make as many B and C as possible by controlling the amount of A.,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,"Because A leads to decreases in B and C, I decide to ensure the level of B and C by controlling the amount of A at an acceptable level.",
151208,d,I,,Sd,,,1a,I raised the sliders to a pretty high level at the beginning in case there's restrictions for raising at the rest steps.,
,,,C,,,,1b,"I don't know anything about the rest of the experiment, so I have to take an advance at the beginning.",
,,,C,,,,2a,"After I see the example, A is getting pretty big when both other the sliders reach to 10. However, there's still some examples shows that A might increase when the first slider is higher than the second slider.",
,,,C,Sd,,,2b,"I don't trust that put both of the sliders to 10 will raise A to the biggest, there has to has something that affects the result.",
,,I,,,,,3a,To make A bigger,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"From the example, it show that when the second slider remains the same, move the first slider bigger will raise A higher than more the third slider bigger. So I keep the first slider in 10. Also, I noticed that the second slider control the base of A, so I keep it in a relatively higher level. For the third slider, it can surely increase A, but in case there are other constrains, I make it relatively lower than other two sliders.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I try to make A and B 50%:50%,
,,I,S,D,C,,4b,"As A raise, B goes down, without any other factors, both A and B are desirable, so I divide the slider to half and half",
,,I,,Sd,C,,5a,I tried to give all to A in the period 1 and give all to B in the period 2,
,,I,S,Sd,C,,5b,"From the example, we can see that even I provide 2 to A at the first period, if I give more at the second period to A, the result could possibly getting larger A. So I give all to A at the first round and then give all to B at the second period, both A and B would have opportunity to have higher level.",
,,I,,,C,,6a,To raise A and B together,
,,I,S,Sd,C,,6b,"From the example, it shows that the change in period 3 has no effect as period 1 and 2. So at the first period, I give A and B half and half. And then, make period 2 and period 3 relatively contrast in other to make the result balance",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"To get higher A, B and C",
,,I,S,D,C,,7b,"from the example, it shows that as the slider getting smaller, we got higher C; the slider getting larger, we got higher B; as the slider getting close to 5, we have larger A. So in order to get more medium number for all three of them, I chose to the medium",
,,,,,,T,8a,".....I try to select 3 and 5, but I forget to click the slider",
,,,S,,,,8b,"I see a pretty nice graph from the example when the slider in first period is 2 and 5 in second period, so I just follow the example. ",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"raise to the medium of all A,B and C",
,,,S,,,,9b,"From the example, it shows that the amount of the dot change mostly based on the first and second period, and the relation between the first and second period is just like last question, so I follow my last decision and then put the third slider to the middle position in order to make just little change to the result from second period. ",
151209,d,I,,,,,1a,Trying to get the highest amount of A that is possible.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,Period of 10 would yield the best outcome.,
,,I,S,,,,2a,Getting the highest total amount of A over 2 periods.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,Putting the sliders at 10 for both period would yield the highest possible total amount of A.,
,,I,,,,,3a,Trying to find the best way to get the highest total amount of A that is possible to achieve.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,Putting the sliders at 10 for each period would yield the highest possible total amount of A over the three periods.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,Trying to maximize the amount of A and B.,
,,I,,,,,4b,"Due to different preferences, I use this strategy to be in the middle where people are indifferent.",
,,I,,,C,,5a,Trying to maximize both amount of A and B over two periods.,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I use this strategy as I believe this way the outcome of A would not make the other outcome worse off.,
,,I,,,C,,6a,Trying to balance the outcome of A and B over the three periods.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"By using this strategy, the outcome of A will not make the outcome of B worse off as they are balanced.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,Trying to get the best outcome in which none of the possible outcomes get worse off.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"By setting the slider at 5, the outcomes are balanced off, and if we are to increase, say A, the other outcomes will get worse off.",
,,I,,,C,,8a,Trying to get the highest possible outcomes for each over two periods.,
,,I,S,,,,8b,"This strategy would yield the highest possible amount of B and C, with at least a little amount of A.",
,,I,,,C,,9a,Trying to maximize the possible outcome.,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,"It makes sense to put all 3 sliders at 0 to maximize the total possible amount of B and C, with the total amount of A is impossible to get worse off.",
151210,b,,,,,,1a,My strategy was just to estimate.,
,,I,C,O,,,1b,"Since the question asked for a 100 year plan and I at this time do not have any research on how much damage this will lake and the environment or how much it will impact the economy, I decided to go about 3/4 ways in the amount of waste per year.",
,,,,,,,2a,I decided to do more waste in the first half of the years and then less in the second half.,
,,I,,O,,,2b,"I used this because logically thinking the since the lake is assuming probably decent now, it will be able to handle more waste but that waste will build up in the next 50 years and the 2nd half could really be a environmental hazard and therefor it is important to lessen the amount of waste.",
,,,,,,,3a,"I decided to do the most waste in the first third, the least waste in the second third and somewhere in the middle in the last third.",
,,I,S,O,,,3b,I did this because the healthy lake can probably take a decent amount now but in the second third there will have to be a smaller amount of waste given due to some damage control. We have to allow the lake to get relatively good again before adding the in the middle amount in the last third.,
,,,,,,,4a,I picked a waste of about .08 per year.,
,,I,S,Am,,,4b,"It seemed reasonable with the new waste removing technology but since it can be harmful to the life in the lake, it cant be utilized at 100% and therefore we should not be dumping as much as we can.",
,,,S,,,,5a,I choose less waste in the first half and more in the second half.,
,,I,,Am,,,5b,I did this because the first half will allow the life of the lake to get used to the waste and the waste elimination thing as well and in the second half hopefully they would have evolved to tolerate more of the waste elimination process.,
,,,,,,,6a,"I picked the least in the first third, the most in the second third and in the middle in the last third.",
,,I,,Am,,,6b,"Assuming that in time (2nd third) the fish will get used to the harmful waste eliminating service, it has the most but in the middle in the last third just in case there isn't that impact, for damage control.",
,,,,,,,7a,I put the waste at .05/year.,
,,I,C,,,,7b,I did this bc that seems reasonable with no research with the understanding that the waste eliminator isn't reliable and that there is natural waste coming into the lake as well.,
,,,,,,,8a,I put in more for the first half and less for the next half.,
,,I,S,Am,,,8b,Having more in the first half will make the economy better and with a better economy a lot of good things could happen such as stability to get resources to eliminate waste more reliably.,
,,,,,,,9a,I did the most in the second third.,
,,I,S,Am,,,9b,I did this because it allows steady economy rise and waste to accustomed to in the life of the lake.,
151211,c,I,S,,,,1a,To determine what part of the scale produced the highest amount of A. I checked the scale in increments and found it was the high end that had the highest amount.,
,,,S,,,,1b,It was the most straight forward,
,,I,S,,,,2a,I determined that both scales were adding A in a positive manner. So then I put them at their maximum.,
,,,S,,,,2b,It was simple and there wasn't much option.,
,,I,S,,,,3a,I determined that all three scales were adding A in a positive manner. I then put them all at their maximum levels.,
,,,S,,,,3b,It seemed the most simple and thorough,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"I kept picking values and analyzing the result. I noticed there was a drop off at 2.8, where there was a lot less B production. So I decided to stay at 2.7 before the dropoff where there was a high B production and some A production.",
,,,,,,,4b,It helped me understand what the relationship between the two was.,
,,I,S,,T,,5a,I moved the first scale until B started to drastically recline. Then I did the same with the second scale. Hoping to get more A but not lose a lot of B.,
,,I,C,,C,,5b,Its more complex now so just trying to maintain a high B and get as much A.,
,,I,S,,T,,6a,I moved the first scale until B dropped off. Then did the same for the second. The third was different and sometimes B would increase then decrease. So I picked a point where B was highest as well as A.,
,,,,,,,6b,It is helpful to play around until you see a trend. Then make decisions from there.,
,,I,S,,T,,7a,Again there was a dropoff. It started with high C and B. I went as far as I could go to get more A until there the amount of C drastically decreased.,
,,I,C,,,,7b,Trying to manage three things is hard. So I'm focusing on getting high of two and the best possible for the third.,
,,I,,,T,,8a,"I focus on keeping B and C high. I moved the first scale until they started to decrease. Then moved the second scale the same, trying to get more A but not losing much of the others.",
,,I,,,,,8b,I tried to keep 2 high and get as much as possible of the third.,
,,I,,,T,,9a,I tried to maintain a high C and B. I moved each scale until they dropped drastically.,
,,I,,,S,,9b,Its better to have more of 2 than only one.,
151212,a,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to achieve the highest economic benefits possible,
,,P,,,,,1b,I used this strategy because I was told that my success was reliant on producing the highest economic benefit,
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to achieve the highest economic benefit,
,,P,,,,,2b,I used this strategy because I was told it would lead to the highest reward,
,,I,,,,,3a,Achieve the highest economic benefit,
,,P,S,,,,3b,I was told that this would yield the highest reward,
,,I,,,T,,4a,I wanted to choose the max amount of waste that could be released before the water quality drastically dropped,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I wanted to release the most amount of waste possible without hindering water quality,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I wanted to release the most waste I could for my economic benefit, but did not want the water quality to drop below 50%",
,,I,,,C,,5b,I wanted to achieve the most economic benefit without compromising drastically on water quality,
,,I,,,C,,6a,To get the most economic benefit without dropping water too much,
,,I,,,C,,6b,"I did not want to drop water quality too much, but I also wanted some economic benefit",
,,I,S,,,,7a,I aimed to keep the water quality and reliability high,
,,I,,,C,,7b,I wanted to keep the water quality and reliability high while also obtaining the most economic benefit,
,,I,,,,,8a,to keep water quality and reliability high,
,,I,,,C,,8b,"It is important to keep the lake enjoyable, but also economic benefits must be achieved",
,,I,,,C,,9a,Maximize water quality and reliability while still gaining economic benefit,
,,I,,,C,,9b,Keep the lake enjoyable and achieve economic benefits,
240104,a,I,S,,,,1a,The more waste that is created allows for more economic benefits towards the factory and helps the economy of the small town.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I choose this strategy because it gave the most economic benefits to everyone.,
,,I,S,,,,2a,The more waste produced allows for more money the factor and the small town.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,This strategy is the best economic solution for all the people in the town.,
,,I,S,,,,3a,This will generate more money to the factory and the people of the town.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,This strategy allows for more economic benefits to the factory and the small town.,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,Having a balance over 100 years of lower water quality and average economic benefits will allow for a partnership that will benefit both parties without harming the lake or receiving low economic benefits.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,The balance allows for a good amount of clean water and the factory still generates money.,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,I decided that the first 50 years would be designed to having better water quality and the last 50 years would have a more economic benefit while still preserving the quality of the water in the lake,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I used this strategy because having better water quality gives the lake a better chance of disposing the waste and the factory can keep a steady income.,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,You pour more waste in the lake in order during the first period and receive more economic benefits. This also allows the later parts to pour less waste and allow the lake to remove the waste better and the factory can have a steady income.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,It balances out the quality of water and economic benefits in installments.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,The balance between the three aspects allows of the best result of all areas.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,All three aspects are still in a good position.,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I was trying to balance all three aspects that allowed for the greatest result.,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,This strategy allows for all three aspects to be maintained and allow for a natural life style between the three aspects.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,I was trying to balance all three aspects that allowed for the best options for all three parts.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,I used this strategy because it allows all three aspects to be maintained.,
240999,a,I,,O,C,,1a,"i tried to minimize the waste but also make a profit, so i split the waste with the profit",
,,I,,O,C,,1b,because my goal is to make a profit but also I am an environmental planner and I need to minimize the waste,
,,,,,,,,,
,,I,,,,,2a,i tried to go heavier on the waste the first 50 years and them stabilize it in the future,
,,I,,,,,3a,"again i decided to split the waste among the years, i started with heavier waste the fist period then it slightly decreased the next period and in the last period i decreased the waste by half from the initial period",
,,I,,,,,3b,"again it seemed like with the passing of the time the waster was less correlated with the profit, therefore i decided to have more waste the first period and way less the last period",
,,I,,,C,,4a,i decided to find a middle spot where the waste is low but the company is making some profit ,
,,I,,,C,,4b,it was impossible to have both no waste and high profits that is  why i decided to fin the middle ground  ,
,,,,,,,5a,this time i increased the waste in the first period and decreased it slightly in the second ,
,,I,,,,,5b,this time it seemed like there was better quality of water even tho i increased the waster from last time,
,,,,,,,6a,"it seemed that the last period did not have that much impact, so i decided not to have any waste. I increased the waste in the first period and slightly in the second ",
,,I,,,S,,6b,it seemed impossible finding the middle ground so i decided to go with cleaner water since there is a danger with the algae and people use the lake for recreational purposes ,
,,I,S,,,,7a,i decided to increase the economic benefits and the water quality,
,,I,C,,C,,7b,i was a little confused by the graph but it seemed like my choice offered the best possible benefits for both the water and the factory ,
,,,,,,,8a,i decided to gradually increase the waste in the passing of the time ,
,,I,S,,S,,8b,i did that in order to increase the economic benefits as much as possible and to decrease the reliability ,
,,I,,,,,9a,again i tried to gradually increase the waste with the years passing ,
,,I,,,C,,9b,it seemed like that gave the best economic benefits while keeping the water somewhat clean,
240106,a,I,,O,,,1a,I was trying to do a half and half thing where half waste is in the lake but also the other side is benefitting as well.,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,I used this strategy because it is like a real life compromise between the two variables given.,
,,I,,O,C,,2a,"I still tried to do the real life compromise between the two variables but I had more waste in the second one because since that determines the economy, if the first portion did not generate a good economy, having more factory production will increase the economy for the second half.",
,,I,,O,C,,2b,"I used this strategy because I was thinking that if the first way doesn't work, we can learn from mistakes and make it better. Also the first portion will have less waste in the lake and by then homes will be filled with people/family and they will be settled down and less likely to move for the second part.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,"Since the first period had a greater ratio of waste to economic benefit, I increased the first period more and had the last period less to recover from the first period.",
,,I,,Am,C,,3b,"I used this strategy because unlike the last one, I now thought maybe people would stay if there were jobs involved and we can help the lake as well in the later periods. I still tried to do the 50/50 compromise as in the other ones.",
,,I,S,,T,,4a,I picked the number .027 for waste because there was a drastic jump from .027 to .028 in water quality and not that big of a change in economic benefits. I was initially trying to have a little more economic benefit until I realized the drastic jump.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I used this strategy because as important as economic benefits is, water quality is as well and the jump that water quality takes if you go to a higher waster number was not reasonable so I stuck with .027.",
,,I,,,T,,5a,"I did the same thing I did in the last one, I tried to pick the very last highest possible number before the water quality jumped drastically low for both. I realized the second period was much lower but I still did it this way so it would match up to the process of the first period.",
,,I,,,T,,5b,"I used this strategy because while both are important, I felt as if it wasn't worth to have the jump on lower water quality for the amount of economic benefit it was receiving. I picked these numbers so the town could benefit from both variables with little change in numbers.",
,,I,,,T,,6a,"I used the same strategy as previous, I tried to pick the numbers before a drastic change occurred in water quality. I realized for the third period it went up as the more waste was put in so I increased the amount of waste. ",
,,I,S,,T,,6b,I used this because both variables are important in this town and a little extra economic benefit would not make it enjoyable or worth it for the big jump in water quality.,
,,I,,,T,,7a,"I did the same thing where I tried to pick the numbers before the drastic change happened, but since we don't know how much natural waste there is, I tried to pick a smaller number for more room for natural waste.",
,,I,S,,T,,7b,"I used this strategy because if I picked the last number possible, then there would be no room for natural waste before the drastic change. ",
,,I,C,D,T,,8a,"This was more difficult because the jump occurred in more than one variable, both economic benefit and water quality. I tried to find the balance of the two as a compromise and still not have a big jump from water quality.",
,,I,,D,T,,8b,"I used this strategy because even though the water quality was lower than other times, the jump that that the economic benefit caused was too high to ignore. ",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"I used the same thing as previous ones but since the last period had smaller decreases in water quality with more waste being put in, I had the last period more since it could generate more waste for more economic benefits than the second where the water would be greatly affected.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,I used this strategy to because I wanted to even out all three variables.,
240109,b,I,,O,C,,1a,"I was trying to create equal benefits on both sides of the situation.  While economic benefits are important, so are the environmental benefits, and I aimed to create a situation where each side saw an equal benefit.  ",
,,I,,O,C,,1b,"I used this strategy because I thought it was the most fair.  If each side sees the same amount of benefits, in my personal belief this would be the ideal situation.  ",
,,I,,O,C,,2a,"I tried to reach a mid point in the economic benefits graph. This seemed to be attainable when waste disposal totaled 0.1. I aimed to generate numbers in each period that would total 0.1.  I noticed in one of the examples, releasing a higher amount of waste into the lake now and a smaller amount later produced a larger economic benefit. I chose to release more waste in the first period. I was trying to create economic benefits while also protecting the lake.",
,,I,,O,C,,2b,"I used this strategy because I thought it was most fair.  There is a huge positive attached to creating economic benefits but at the same time the lake matters to the residents of the town, so I wanted to ensure both sides of the situation were appeased, and I thought my strategy was the best way to go about making that happen.  ",
,,I,,Am,,,3a,"I was trying to create the most economic benefit, and so I maximized the waste in the first period to do this.  However, I made sure to decrease the waste in each subsequent period so I could advertise the plan as one that decreased the amount of waste that goes into the lake over the next 100 years.",
,,I,,Am,,,3b,"I used this strategy because I believe people will benefit more from economic gains even if they don't realize it.  By advertising this as a plan that reduces the amount of waste going into the lake each period, it will not only make the people happy but also create many economic benefits. ",
,,I,,,T,,4a,"I was trying to find a point where the water quality was high so the lake could fight off waste itself but also make sure there were economic benefits.  At the point 0.03, the water quality was so low that the other life in the lake would have died, and I wanted to make sure I preserved the lake.  ",
,,P,,,,,4b,"I used this strategy because my success depended on both the economic benefits and quality of the water. Looking back, I should have maximized the waste output in previous situations because my success was only measured on economic benefits, but my role as environmental planner morally prevented me from doing that. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to create a situation where both the water quality and economic benefits same similar outcomes.  I aimed to choose two numbers that I thought would provide the most benefit for both sides of the situation. ,
,,P,,,,,5b,I used this strategy because my success depended on both water quality and economic benefits. ,
,,I,,,C,,6a,"I was trying to find a spot where both economic benefits and water quality saw similar outcomes. To do this I released increasing amounts of waste into the lake, so the initial water quality was better and economic gains, while still present in the short run, will be greater in the long run.",
,,P,,,,,6b,I used this strategy because my success depended on both the economic benefits and water quality. ,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"I tried to pick a number where my reliability was high but also where the water quality and economic benefits saw increases as well.  In looking at the examples, I saw that 0.02 did not produce enough economic gains but that 0.05 did not have reliability or water quality at good levels.  For that reason, I chose 0.035, right in the middle of the two.  ",
,,P,,,,,7b,"I used this strategy because my success depended on the water quality, economic benefits, and reliability. ",
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I was trying to ensure that water quality, economic benefits, and reliability were all maximized.  In one of the examples I saw that in period one a waste total of 0.02 worked well, but followed by 0.05 the next year offset that benefit, so I decided to keep the 0.02 in the first period and only increase the waste to 0.025 in the second period to promote economic gains but also to make sure I did not lose touch with water quality and reliability.",
,,P,,,,,8b,"I used this strategy because my success depended on the water quality, economic benefits, and reliability.  I also think increased economic benefits are important, so that is why I allowed the waste total to increase form period 1 to 2",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I was trying to make sure the reliability was high was also ensuring there were visible economic benefits and maintain good water quality.  I did this by allowing the waste to increase from period 1 to 2 to promote economic benefits, but I also decreased waste from period 2 to 3 to ensure the lake did not get taken over by algae. ",
,,P,,,C,,9b,"I used this strategy because my success depended on all three factors, and I wanted to have a period of economic growth as well as ensure the quality and reliability of the lake. ",
240110,d,I,,,,,1a,"As the planner, I was trying to maximize the amount of A earned. I made sure that the box was filled with as much orange as possible when making my decision.",
,,,S,,,,1b,"In my perspective, the more orange in the box meant more A.",
,,I,,,,,2a,"I was trying to maximize the amount of A, or the amount of orange in the box. I submitted 10 for both periods.",
,,I,S,,,,2b,"The task is to maximize A, so that is what I aimed to do. ",
,,I,,,,,3a,"I was trying to maximize A, so I chose to fill the orange box as much as possible.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"The task said to maximize A, so I set all periods on level 10.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I wanted to maximize the levels of A and B without hurting each factor. I chose 5 because based on examples, it seemed that it would be the closest to a midpoint between the two. ",
,,P,,,,,4b,I wanted to get the most payout for my decision. I thought this would be the most successful decision.,
,,,,,,T,5a,I accidentally submitted this.,
,,,,,,T,5b,"I wanted to place the bars on 3 and 5, but was looking at the sample and just submitted it",
,,I,,,C,,6a,I wanted to maximize A and B without hurting A or B by maximizing one of them. ,
,,I,,,,,6b,I used examples and tweaked it to eyeball where I think the orange dot would fall on the graph.,
,,I,C,,C,,7a,"I am trying to maximize A B and C. In all honesty, I do not understand this graph so I was not sure how to make a decision. I tried to look at an example to get a better idea of where to place the dot. ",
,,,C,,,,7b,Not sure...used intuition.,
,,,C,,,,8a,I do not know,
,,,C,,,,8b,I do not know,
,,,C,,,,9a,I do not know,
,,,C,,,,9b,I do not know,
240111,c,I,S,,,,1a,My strategy was to maximize the A. It said there were no cost so of course I went for the maximum amount of A.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,There was no punishment for sliding the bar to maximum A so therefore I implemented this strategy. ,
,,I,S,,,,2a,My strategy was to maximize A with the sliders by testing out how each sliders affected the level of A. I found out that the one slider fills up 2/3 of the bar while the other filled up the other third. Thus I went for 10s on each one. ,
,,I,,,,,2b,This strategy seemed like the most logical one to test out the slider and again there were no penalties for sliding the bar to the maximum. ,
,,I,S,,,,3a,My strategy was to maximize A again. This time there were three sliders so I tested them all individually. They were all able to increase A with direct correlation to increasing the number. So to maximize A I set the sliders to 10 for each one. ,
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used this strategy because this was the most logical thought processing. There were no penalties again so I would always want to maximize A during the times where there are no penalties. ,
,,I,,,,,4a,"My objective was just trying to maximize the total of A + B. Originally after reading the instructions I thought 5 would be the best number because it will be the average which means satisfies half the people and the other half. After playing around with the scale, I found that 2.7 looked like it had the most area covered on the graph when going from the x and y axis to meet with my fingers. ",
,,I,S,,,,4b,I used this strategy because the goal was to maximize the total of A + B. ,
,,I,,,,,5a,I was trying to maximize the length of A + B. I played around with the two scales and choose the combination that looked like that had the most total of A+B. ,
,,I,S,,,,5b,I used this strategy because the goal was to have the max( A+B). ,
,,I,,,,,6a,I was trying to maximize A+B with the three sliders. After playing around with the sliders 2.5 for all three seemed like the best results. ,
,,I,S,,,,6b,I used this strategy because the goal was to maximize A+B.,
,,I,S,,S,,7a,My goal was to maximize A+B+C. At zero level we minimized A but maximized both B and C. This opportunity outweighs the opportunity cost of just A. ,
,,I,S,,,,7b,I used this strategy because I wanted to achieve a high level of A+B+C. ,
,,I,,,,,8a,Was trying to maximize A+B+C. I was playing around with sliders to try to get the yellow point to the most arrows as possible while trying to minimize A as this draws both C and B down. ,
,,I,,,S,,8b,I used this strategy because having B and C be high seems better than having just A being high. ,
,,I,,,,,9a,I was trying to get the most A+B+C. I tried to increase A with the least amount of B and C being punished.,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I used this strategy to try to optimize the efficiency of A while trying not to decrease B and C. ,
240113,a,I,S,O,,,1a,Maximize the economy to waste ratio. The more econ that per unit waste can produce the better.,
,,,,,,,1b,no detail graph provided and other conditions are limited. Logic decision is favored.,
,,I,S,Sd,,,2a,"maximizing the profit, which is the econ to waste ratio. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,"the more was in the first 50 years produced the better, so I assigned more waste to the first 50 years",
,,,,,,,3a,I discovered that there is a weight to the econ/waste ratio. So the decision are made through a weighted process.,
,,,S,D,,,3b,The decision seems fit in the simple weighted ratio in this chart.,
,,,S,,,,4a,choose the dot closet to the efficiency curve.,
,,,S,,,,4b,there is a three part trend in the graph. so I choose the one that benefit the environment more.,
,,,S,,C,,5a,Choose the curve part that yields the most benefit to both the environment and the econ.,
,,,,,,,5b,last 50 years gave a lower yield to the per unit waste.,
,,,S,,,,6a,I gave the time period that could yield more econ value better weight,
,,,S,,,,6b,maximize the profit that I can make out of the ratio,
,,,S,,,,7a,Maximize the environment benefit,
,,,,,,,7b,Because the water quality is more important in the long-term development plan.,
,,,S,,,,8a,Stay on the efficiency curve's balanced side.,
,,,,,,,8b,To yield benefits and protect environment in the long term,
,,,,,,,9a,Focus on first and third period,
,,,,,,,9b,Second period does no yield benefit,
240114,b,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to balance not having too much waste in the lake while also letting the factory run because its important for economic growth.,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,The lake is important because the community is relies on it but the factory also provides job so i knew it was important to find a balance,
,,I,,O,C,,2a,I was trying to keep the economic benefit high enough that the factory could run but also not too high that it would damage the lake beyond repair. ,
,,I,,O,,,2b,As an environmentalist it is important to protect the lake so it can be used for future generations but the town also relies on the factory.,
,,,,,,,3a,i alternated how much waste was allowed in the lake every 33 years,
,,I,,,,,3b,My thought was that if it started out with less waste and then went up to more waste and then back down there wouldn't be a complete 100 year period where there is a lot of waste being generated. only 33% of that time would there be a significant amount.,
,,I,,,,,4a,I maximized the amount of waste to a point where I thought the lake could sustain that amount of waste in it.,
,,I,,,,,4b,"The lake is used for recreational purposes and with too much waste, the waster life will begin to die. However, you need to allow some waste in because if not the factory cannot operate.",
,,,,,,,5a,I thought in between example 2 and 3 so i picked the number between those two,
,,I,,Sd,,,5b,I thought it allowed for little waste at first and then more waste in 2nd part of it because the lake would be able to better sustain it then,
,,,,,,,6a,I started off with a lesser amount of waste being allowed than i gradually increased it,
,,I,,Sd,,,6b,By gradually increasing it my thought was that there wouldn't be a huge build up during the 100 year period,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I tried to even out the benefits and water quality while taking into account the other waste,
,,I,S,,,,7b,I didnt know how much waste will be there so i allowed enough room that if there was other waste it would not completely take over,
,,I,,,C,,8a,By using the example i tried to find the best way to allow there to be enough waste and then gradually increase it to help the factory,
,,I,,,,,8b,The factory is important but so is the lake and you have to take into account the unknown variable ,
,,,,,,,9a,I allowed there to be a less amount of waste and then i increased it and then decreased it again,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,This way the lake will not be overwhelmed with a ton of waste but the factory can still operate,
240115,d,,C,,,,1a,"Since it was the first round, I didn't know exactly what to do but I generally had higher periods to achieve a higher A.",
,,,,,,,1b,I thought that maybe a longer period would give more time to have a higher A.,
,,,,,,,2a,I noticed that the higher A was determined on a longer period 1 than 2. ,
,,I,,,,,2b,I used this to hopefully get a higher A. ,
,,,,,,,3a,I noticed that having a longer Period 1 and 2 and shorter 3 created higher A values. ,
,,I,,,,,3b,To achieve a greater A. ,
,,,C,,S,,4a,It would've been a shot in the dark to guess a number between 7-9 because it could've fallen in the area of a lower A and lower B. So instead I went with a higher period that would give a high A and low B.,
,,I,,,S,,4b,To achieve a higher A. ,
,,,S,,S,,5a,I went with lower periods for each to mimic the example of a high B and lower A. ,
,,I,,,S,,5b,Because this round I wanted to favor B instead of A. ,
,,,S,,S,,6a,I went off of the example where all three periods were lower to achieve a high B value. ,
,,I,,,S,,6b,To get a higher B value. It did not seem like you could get a high A value without having a drastically low B.,
,,,S,,,,7a,I set a low period because that gave higher values for each one.,
,,I,,,C,,7b,"To achieve a high A, B, and C. ",
,,,,,C,,8a,I tried to pick a period where it gave the highest values for each one. ,
,,,,,C,,8b,I didn't want to sacrifice value any when picking a period so used one that would hopefully benefit all three.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"Since B and C aren't related, I wanted to pick something where each get a somewhat higher value.",
,,,,,C,,9b,"Did not want to pick one over the other, so I had both get an average value on the graph.",
240116,c,I,,O,,,1a,"It said my job was to manage A and that higher A was desireable. It doesn't cost to slide A, so I set it to almost maximum in case their was room for error.",
,,I,S,,,,1b,"Again, it said higher A was desirable so I slid the arrow to the top to get the maximum A.",
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to get the Maximum Amount of A,
,,I,S,O,,,2b,Using the sliders was not restricted or costly. I just moved the sliders until I got the maximum amount of A. I left a little room in case for error. ,
,,I,,,,,3a,Higher A was desirable so I tried to get more A.,
,,I,S,O,,,3b,Slider 1 produced the most all so I went to it's max. Slider 2/3 produced less A than Slider 1. I left those a little less than 2 in case of room for error. ,
,,I,,,C,,4a,Trying to get the most A and B,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I got the most B without sacrificing A. If I moved it towards A by a point, I lost a lot more B. In total, I got more desirability. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I tried to get the maximum A and B,
,,,,,,T,5b,The computer froze so I do not know what I submitted. ,
,,I,,,C,,6a,Trying to get the maximum total of A and B,
,,I,S,D,,,6b,"It hurt more B if I tried to get more B, so I maximized B because it wants the total of A and B",
,,I,,,C,,7a,"Get the most of A,B,and C in total",
,,I,,,S,,7b,I tried to get more C and B because more A would hurt the two. ,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"Getting the maximum amount of a,b,c.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"Using A meant losing B and C. The goal is to get the total A,B,C so I focused on maximizing B and C without losing too much A",
,,I,,,C,,9a,I was trying to maximize B and C and a little bit of A. Get the most in total.,
,,I,,,S,,9b,More A hurt B and C so I tried to get as much B and C instead,
240117,a,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to make sure the company had a sufficient amount of economical benefits disregarding the environmental damage.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because it was the best for the business.,
,,I,,O,C,,2a,I was trying to achieve the greatest economically gain without harming the environment too much. ,
,,I,,O,C,,2b,"The bottom slider seemed to do significantly less damage to my economical gain, therefore, I did not put it too high in an attempt to help the environment.",
,,I,,O,C,,3a,Make the most money without harming the environment too much.,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,"The bottom 2 periods seemed to do significantly less damage to my economical gain, therefore, I did not put it too high in an attempt to help the environment.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying to have economical benefits without having the water quality ruined.,
,,I,S,,,,4b,"I used this strategy because if the water became too damaged, the lake would be ruined",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to have economical benefits without having the water quality ruined.,
,,I,C,,C,,5b,"It was hard to do, so I chose a spot where the water quality and economical benefit both suffered the same.",
,,I,,,C,,6a,"I tried to make the suffering between water quality and economical benefit, identical",
,,I,,,C,,6b,I chose this strategy because I wanted to be fair and keep the lake healthy.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I was trying to keep the water quality high as well as benefits.,
,,,,,,,7b,I feel as though they were important,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"Keep the benefits, reliability, and water quality at good rates.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,I used this strategy because then the lake will be great and so will the money.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"Keep the benefits, reliability, and water quality at good rates.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,To ensure that reliability wasn't too low as well as the others.,
240118,c,I,,Sd,,,1a,the higher the better results however I did not want to select 10 as there is risk involved,
,,I,,O,,,1b,the risk would out due the profit in this interface as your a planner trying to accommodate many different factors ,
,,I,S,Am,,,2a,Strategy: level the period 1 as it was early and can account for mistakes and then raise stakes in period 2 as the time pressure increases,
"Note: This person's responses mix A,B,C objectives with water, economic, reliability objectives- why?",,I,,Am,,,2b,I think it is necessary to allow for flexibility in the period 1 and then account for the various demands and differences needed to support the business in period 2 by raising ,
,,I,S,Am,,,3a,Period 1 - assessment : Period 2 - implementation : Period 3 - monitoring,
,,I,S,Am,,,3b,"In theory, when planning in stages there are adjustments made all the time, these lower end sliders in periods 1 and 2 can assist in those changes without hurting the business. Once the plan is implemented and being monitored regularly it will increase as i showed in period 3",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I wanted to provide a balance between A and B and 3 was the most desirable although it was lower on each ,
,,I,,,C,,4b,Give and take is part of business and in order to not take away from B I wanted to maintain a lower A,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,provide a clear and even slope for both to setup a path that allows both growth,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"After some analyzing, period 1 was the period controlling most of the decisions ans period 2 would support those by leaning either way. Therefore, I balanced them close to evenly in order to experience my desired end result of a positive slope. ",
,,I,,,,,6a,"For this, I was trying to lean on the side of A with also keeping B in mind",
,,I,,,,,6b,I want to see returns and generate the best case for A but do not want to harm the business with B,
,,I,,,S,,7a,"this option satisfied two of the 3, I wanted to obtain the most ideal situation for all C suffered ",
,,I,,,,,7b,I believe it was more crucial to succeed in water and economic ,
,,I,,,S,,8a,focus on reliability and water quality more than economic benefit,
,,,,,,,8b,establish strength and ensure there was growth,
,,I,,,T,,9a,optimize up C however the stages were influenced by thresholds and it would begin to shift once another period was passing,
,,I,,,,,9b,ideal situation would be meeting a strong reliability and the other factors,
240119,d,,,,,,1a,I chose to set the slide bar to the point where it's almost in the midst of the period.,
,,,,,,,1b,"After seeing the example provided, as a conservative, I'd always like to stay in the middle, or the average point.",
,,,,,,,2a,"I'm trying to dedicate my full efforts in both the first and the second period. Because there're two stages/ slide bars that I can adjust, I used the model in the upper right corner and tried several times. I observed that inputs/ efforts in the first period contribute more to the overall production of A than does that from the second period. But only when both periods reach full potential, the max amount of A is generated. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,"I use the strategy because only when both period reach full potential of 10, the A reaches its optimal production. ",
,,,S,,,,3a,"Same strategy from last scenario applies here, in order to reach the highest level of A, for each phases number must be their max.",
,,I,,,,,3b,"Mentioned in the prompt that input of resource is unrestricted and that is an advantage. If I was the planner, I would definitely take advantage of everything that's made available to me. AKA, adjusting all the phases' slide bars to the max number. ",
,,I,,,C,,4a,"attempting at equally satisfying both objectives, fulfill one requirement without satisfying the other. ",
,,I,,,C,,4b,"As mentioned in the prompt that higher degrees of either A or B attracts different groups of people, and if A, B are the collective reference, say, for the features of my product, I would like it to target a broader group of potential customers.",
,,I,,,C,,5a,"same with last scenario, I'm trying to equally satisfying both objectives, A and B. ",
,,I,,,C,,5b,"I adjusted the slide bar 1 and observed that it might have a direct impact on A, regardless of slide bar 2's presence. I interpret that possibly slide bar 1 might not affect B's production as much as it's on A's. Therefore, I put phase 1 to 10, as if the production of A is maintained through a most effective way. While making sure A is generated, I adjusted phase 2 to 5, so that there's perhaps a balance between A and B, presuming that it will pose equal effect on both.",
,,I,C,,C,,6a,"achieve certain degree of B's production, without much sacrificing A. After observing the model, the determinants for B's production appear unclear. ",
,,I,,,,,6b,"After adjusting the model for several times, I suppose that phase 3 has little to no effect on production of A. Thus, only considering the first two phases; phase 1 has impact on both A and B, and it seems that phase 2 is the most influential determinant on A's production. Thus I pushed phase 2's slide bar to the very right.",
,,I,,,,,7a,trying to be conservative,
,,I,,,,,7b,risk averse,
,,I,,,C,,8a,generating most b and c without sacrificing much of A,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"B and c are not interrelated, I put phase 2 to the moderate level, because it affects more on b and c than on A, and adjust the phase 1 to make sure that A can also be produced at a certain level.",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"mostly based on feeling, I tried my best to maximize production of B and C and to a certain degree not affecting A.",
,,I,C,,,,9b,phase 1's impact on all three objectives is unclear. It seems that less phase 3 input generates more of B and C. ,
240120,b,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to get as much economic benefit as possible,
,,P,,,,,1b,Because I would get the highest payment ,
,,,,,,,2a,I was trying to get the best economic benefits I could. This meant moving the sliders all the way to the right,
,,P,S,,,,2b,Because I will get higher payment the better the economic benefits are ,
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to get the highest economic benefits I could for the town,
,,P,S,,,,3b,Because I would get higher payment the better the plan was ,
,,I,,,T,,4a,I was trying to balance the amount of waste with the water quality. From 0.02 to 0.03 the water quality drastically dropped so I put it in between those values at 0.025,
,,I,,,C,,4b,Because I thought it was the best way to balance both,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to balance the economic benefits of the town with the water quality,
,,P,,,,,5b,Because I was trying to get the highest payout,
,,I,,,C,,6a,Trying to balance the quality of the water with the economic benefits of the town,
,,P,,,,,6b,I used this strategy because I thought it would give me the highest payment,
,,I,,,,,7a,I was trying to make sure the lake did not become unenjoyable,
,,P,S,,,,7b,To get the highest payment,
,,,,,,,8a,I used the examples to estimate where I should put the sliders,
,,P,S,,,,8b,To get the highest payment possible ,
,,,,,,,9a,I used the examples to try to estimate where to put the sliders,
,,P,,,,,9b,I wanted to get the highest payment possible,
240121,d,I,,,,,1a,"We wanted to maximize A, and in order to do so the more that it was filled, the higher the value there was on the slider. ",
We?,,I,S,,,,1b,"Based on the example, and where the bar was filled to, moving the slider all the way to the right was my bests choice to maximize A and the slider does not change per bar. ",
,,,S,,,,2a,"Looking at the examples, and where the bar was filled to, one example had both at 10 and the bar was filled, so that was the choice I made. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,Because of the example proof that 10 and 10 give a lot of A.,
,,,S,,,,3a,"The more all of the sliders were close to 10, the more orange there was. ",
,,,S,,,,3b,I used this because the examples showed that moving the sliders near 10 was a smart choice. ,
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I was trying to see which number would allow the most for both A and B, 2 seemed to do this because that was the option with the highest values of both numbers. ",
,,I,,,T,,4b,"Because it allowed both A and B to be as high as possible because once 3 was hit, the one side, I think A, really decreased. ",
,,,,,,,5a,"Based on the examples, one bar looked like as it got closer to 10, it was higher on A, and one bar looked like the lower it was the closer it was to B. ",
,,,,,,,5b,Based off of comparing the lengths of the examples. ,
,,,C,D,,,6a,"This one is hard to pinpoint which bar correlates to which line.  I set them all in the middle because there was proof that A was still a 10, and B was a 0.",
,,,,,,,6b,Based off of the examples. ,
,,,S,,,,7a,"Based on the examples, the best choice was 5. ",
,,,,,,,7b,This was based off of the images because slight movements caused major moves with 3 variables. ,
,,,S,,,,8a,"I looked at the examples and saw where the best choice was, from there I went and I moved them a bit. ",
,,,,,,,8b,Because the examples seem like proof. ,
,,,,,C,,9a,"Based off of the example, this seemed to give the most of both. ",
,,,S,,,,9b,I used this because of the example proof. ,
240123,b,I,S,O,C,,1a,"My strategy was to release a little more than half of the waste allotted into the lake, so the factory could survive and not completely destroy the lake.",
,,I,S,O,,,1b,"I did this because it said the town relied on the factory to keep the economy afloat and create jobs. But if I was to release all the waste the lake would be completely destroyed. I decided to release a good amount to waste to keep the towns economy, but not completely destroy the lake for economic gain.",
,,,,,,,2a,I chose to release .9 waste in the next 50 years and .7 waste in 50-100 years.,
,,I,,Am,,,2b,I chose to do this because the town solely relies on the factory in the present so I released a lot of waste to stimulate the economy. They I hope in the future the town can create a cleaner way to run the factory so eventually in the future they can slowly emit less and less waste. ,
,,,,,,,3a,I used the same general strategy as before. I released more waste in the first 33 yrs and then slowly released less and less waste.,
,,I,S,Am,,,3b,"I chose this strategy for the same reason as I did before. I want to stimulate the towns economy as much as possible now so they can slowly wean off the factory, create more industry, and find a cleaner way to make the economy run.",
,,,,,,,4a,I chose to release .5 waste into the lake for the next 100 yrs.,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I chose this plan because in this situation I was asked to balance equally between economic factors and the quality of the water. This seems like the fairest way to help both the environment and the economy at the same time.,
,,,,,,,5a,In my strategy I chose .5 waste for the first 50 yrs and lowered it down to .3 for the last 50 yrs.,
,,I,S,Am,C,,5b,"I decided to do this because in the short term this is only one option of where the waste goes so I split it equally between economic and environmental gain, but in the long term I lowered waste to .3 because I believe by then we will have either stimulated the economy to other areas, or new technology will give us a way to put less waste into the lake.",
,,,,,,,6a,"In my strategy I release .5 into the lake the first 33 yrs, then .35 the next 33yrs, and finally .2 the last 33 yrs.",
,,I,S,Am,C,,6b,"I chose to do this because of the same reason as the last one. I want to equally spit importance between lake and factory in the short term, and then gradually look to other solutions for the waste, whether it be new industry or new technology.",
,,,,,,,7a,I chose to release waste at .3 over the next 100 yrs.,
,,I,S,,,,7b,I decided on this strategy because we cannot completely shut downt he factory because it will cripple our town economy. But now we have to considered water quality and the natural waste coming into the lake. To be sure we don't destroy the lake we must seriously slow downt he waste fromt he factory.,
,,,,,,,8a,I chose to release .3 waste over the first 50 yrs and then slow it down to .2 over the next 50 yrs.,
,,I,,Am,,,8b,"I chose to do this because I gradually want to move away from the factory as the towns main economy, but I do believe we still need it in the short run.",
,,,,,,,9a,"I decided to start off with .35 waste in the first 33 yrs, they bring it to .25 and finally .1.",
,,I,S,,,,9b,"I decided to do this because we currently rely on the factory as our main source of economy, but as we progress as a town we should release less and less waste to preserve the lake's quality.",
240124,c,,S,,,,1a,the goal was to maximize A and since it was a bar graph with A as the only variable it indicated to me to maximize it would be to fill the bar graph to the top.,
,,,S,,,,1b,It seemed logical as A was the only variable and the higher the bar graph the more A was produced,
,,I,S,,,,2a,the goal was to maximize a over the entire period and thus I put each slider to maximum because together at maximum they generate the most amount of A in the bar graph. I did notice that more A was generated in the first period than the second but having them both at the max together generated the most amount of A.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,It seemed most logical to me - I tried having the sliders at different points separately - but noticed that together the max amount of a generated was when both periods were at 10. ,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"Again the goal was to maximize A - ie have the most amount of the graph filled - and thus I set each stage to the max value. I noticed that as the stages went on, less A was generated but again to maximize A over the period was having them all at the maximum value ",
,,,C,,,,3b,This again seemed most logical to me and I played around with the sliders but still the bar for A was most full when they were all set to 10. I'm starting to doubt my decisions as either my reasoning is correct or I clearly don't understand ,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"the goal was to max both A and B - but more A meant less B. In playing around with the sliders, I noticed that after 2.7 A there was a significant drop in B. Following that for small gains in A, B dropped even lower. I decided to keep B at a high level even though A wasn't that high.",
,,I,,,T,,4b,"I used this strategy because it seemed like it would give me the best result. Even though A was a fairly low level, B was high so when looking at them together it still seemed like a good result. Also it seemed that with small increases in A B  kept dropping futher - and it didn't seem like those gains in A were worth losing more B",
,,I,S,,T,,5a,The goal was trying to maximize both a and b - and thus I first found the point in period 1 where any more A led to a large drop off in B. Then I did the same in period 2 - and I found for that period it was barily worth it to increase A because it led to significant drop in B. ,
,,I,S,,S,,5b,Although again A wasn't that high when looking at maximizing both a and b together I felt this was the best solution since with a high A you  lose more and more b. this way by keeping B high and A low at least one is not getting that extra negative effect of adding more A. I also barely moved the second slider as it did not provide much gain to do so - and more so loss of B,
,,I,S,,T,,6a,the goal was to max a and b - and thus I first tried all the sliders to see where the drop off point was for each - ie where the amount of b went down drastically with a small increase in A. I noticed the second slider was the important one - and thus I found that point first (it was the furtherest amt of A where B wasn't far down) and then moved the other two sliders until they had a drastic effect. ,
,,I,S,,T,,6b,I used this because seeing that the second slider would keep the most amount of B while going across it seemed logical. Also not ruining that with the other sliders and just moving them until they would have caused a more drastic changed also seemed logical ,
,,I,,,T,,7a,I was trying to max all 3 - and I found that falling off point where more A lead to a drastic decrease in B and C,
,,,C,,,,7b,I honestly thought it seemed like my best option - however the graph is super confusing with all those variables and how to keep them all maximized  ,
,,I,S,,T,,8a,The goal was to maximize all 3 so I found those drop off points and played with the sliders until it seemed like with another small move of a in either period it would lead to a large drop off.,
,,I,S,,,,8b,I felt this was the best option on how to approach it - its clear they cant all be maximized at once but this way it seemed that up to the point where there were gains in  a the losses in the other 2 didn't seem that large ,
,,I,S,,T,,9a,the goal was to max all 3 - played around with the sliders to see where drop offs were and also the trend for the period - these three values seemed like the most efficient answers in keeping b and c high while trying to max A,
,,I,S,,,,9b,It honestly seemed like the best option following the trend from all the other graphs - I felt that the small decreases in B and C were worth moving A up to a point in each period,
240125,c,I,,D,,,1a,"I was trying to see which setting would give me the most A during the period. In this part, it worked out to be the longest period gave the highest A.",
,,I,S,,,,1b,It made sense based on having only one scrollbar and the option that gave the most A.,
,,I,S,,,,2a,"My strategy was to get the most A over the period. In this section, both slide bars increased the amount of A, so by putting both slidebars at their maximum, i was able to maximize the amount of A received. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,It worked out to give me the most A overall. ,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"My strategy was to achieve the highest amount of A. To do this, I increased each slider to their maximum value, which led to the highest overall amount of A. I tested to make sure that none of the sliders had any negative impact on the overall total. Noticing that they did not, I used the max value.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I tested to make sure that none of the three sliders had any negative impact on the total. By doing this, i saw that all periods would increase the total amount of A, giving me the maximum possible amount.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I tried to find a setting that would be about as equal for both A and B as possible. ,
,,I,,,C,,4b,"When making decisions, sometimes a compromise is best and I try to find a spot in the middle that  pleases both sides. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I did a lot of trial and error, trying to find a spot where both A and B were somewhat equal. Since you can't have a lot of one without giving up a lot of the other, i wanted to try to be equal in both parts. ",
,,I,,,C,,5b,"When making decisions, sometimes a compromise is best and I try to find a spot in the middle that  pleases both sides. ",
,,I,,,C,,6a,I tried to find the spot where all three sliders worked to get an equal amount of A and B. It took a lot of trial and error of moving the sliders to get something close to even. ,
,,I,,,C,,6b,"I wanted to find a happy medium between both A and B. If I had a lot of A, I had very little B, so finding a spot where I could have some of both was the ideal scenario for me. ",
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I wanted to find the spot in the period where I could maximize all three A, B and C. I clicked on each individual mark and eventually found what I think is the best scenario.",
,,,,,,,7b,"In order to maximize one, you have to sacrifice others. If we are looking to maximize all three at the same time, then finding a spot where they are all as close to equal as possible seemed logical. ",
,,I,C,,C,,8a,"I was trying to find the spot where all three items would be as close to equal as possible. This was difficult because each setting changed the location and amount of one of the three options, so trial and error and determining the best setting was tricky.",
,,I,,,C,,8b,"I didn't want to have all of one item and then very little of the others. I wanted to get the most of all of them that I could, without sacrificing much of any of the others. ",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I was trying to find the spot where i can get the most out of all three items. Using trial and error and different settings, I was able to find what I think is a good spot",
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I didn't want to have too much of one and very little of another, so I wanted to find a spot where they were as equal as possible. ",

,,,,,,,3a,more waste in the 1st few years. then gradual decrease,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,Similar reason as to the last reason. Economic benefits are just one part of the equation - one must look at all costs (in this case environment) when making decisions,

240128,a,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits while ensuring that the lake was over polluted so the town could still enjoy the lake.  ,
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"I used this strategy so that the town could continue operating the factory and grow the economy, without eliminating the enjoyment of the lake.  Too little pollution ruins the economic benefit of the factory, while too much ruins the enjoyment of the lake.",
,,I,,O,C,,2a,"My strategy was to understand the impact of each time period on economic benefits.  When I realized that more economic benefits were gained from higher pollution during the early period, I focused on reducing pollution in the later period without eliminating too much economic profit.  ",
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,"This ensures benefits of both economic profit and the lake for the next 49 years, without over polluting the lake so people of the town can enjoy the lake. ",
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to get the highest economic benefit per unit of waste.  ,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"Since the economic benefit of waste was higher during the first two periods, it made more sense to pollute more during the first period, slightly less in the second period, and very little in the third.  ",
,,I,,,T,,4a,I clicked at each point in the slider to see if there was a drop off point in the graph where water quality decreased dramatically for very little marginal gain in economic profit.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I found the drop off point occurred at .27 units of waste/year and since it dropped the water quality significantly at that point, it didn't make sense to go any further into economic profit creation because the lake would be useless to the town.",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I tried to maximize economic profit while minimizing pollution.  ,
,,I,S,,T,,5b,I noticed there were certain drop off points where a large amount of water quality was sacrificed for very little economic gain.  I stopped polluting at the point where water quality dropped severely for little economic gain.,
,,I,,,T,,6a,I tried to maximize water quality and economic gain through looking for points  during each period where water quality drastically changed.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,It ensures sustainability of both the factory and the lake.  ,
,,I,,,T,,7a,"I tried to find the pivotal point where drastic changes in reliability, water quality, or economic benefit occurred in order to maximize reliability, economic benefit, and reliability.",
,,I,S,,T,,7b,"After playing with the slider, I noticed key points where water quality, economic benefit, and reliability changed significantly.  Through noticing these changes, I was able to maximize water quality, economic benefit, and reliability.",
,,I,S,,T,,8a,"Through noticing drop off points in each category and trying to get the most economic benefit compared to the loss in reliability and water quality, I was able to maximize each category while producing economic benefit.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,This strategy pays attention to the problems with water quality while still focusing on the generation of economic benefit.,
,,I,S,,T,,9a,"I tried to maximize each category without ruining the water quality.  Through noticing the changes occurring per each unit of waste, I noticed key points where water quality was damaged significantly in each period.",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"It helps ensure that the water quality remains high, while still making sure economic profit keeps the town running.  ",
240129,d,I,S,,,,1a,Generate as much A as possible.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because the only goal given to me was to generate as much A as possible. There was no information regarding consequences of generating too much A or having excess A.,
,,I,,,,,2a,Manage production across both periods to obtain a higher total A.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy to obtain a higher total A across the entire planning period.,
,,I,S,O,,,3a,"My strategy was to choose the option that produced higher amounts of A in the first two periods and stagnated production in the third period, to ensure we did not overproduce.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I used this strategy because although a higher total amount of A is desired, this strategy manages A better across the entire planning period.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,To find a point on the graph where a relatively equal amount of A and B were being produced.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"By using this strategy, I found the point at which increasing the production of A would lower the production of B, which is what we do not want.",
,,I,S,,C,,5a,My strategy was to choose an option that produced equal amounts of A and B.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy because it seemed that the slider options produced a point at which producing more A would decrease the production of B.,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,My strategy was to find the option that produces both the most A and B.,
,,I,,,C,,6b,I used this strategy because the only other option besides this one produced more A but less B.,
,,I,,,,,7a,"I was trying to manage the product of A, B, and C over the entire planning period.",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"I used this strategy because the option I chose produced a relatively high amount of A, which would lead to moderate production of both B and C.",
,,I,,,C,,8a,I was trying to produce enough A to support moderate production of B and C.,
,,I,S,,,,8b,"I used this strategy because it best manages A, B and C over the entire planning period.",
,,I,,,,,9a,"To manage production of A, B and C best across all planning periods.",
,,I,S,,,,9b,I used this strategy because the option I chose had optimal amounts of production. Increasing production of any line decreased production of the others in the other options.,
240130,a,I,,,,,1a,Create the highest economic benefit by determining the amount of waste released by the lake.,
,,P,,,,,1b,"The directions told me that to succeed, I needed to choose the highest economic benefit possible.",
,,I,,O,C,,2a,Create the highest economic benefit without releasing the maximum amount of waste.,
,,I,,O,C,,2b,"The directions told me to choose what will give me the highest economic benefit, but I also feel I should not release the maximum amount of waste possible into the lake.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,"I used the same strategy as before. This time, I staggered the amount of waste released. I released a lot at first, then lowered the amount each year. ",
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,"Economic benefit was still high, but the lake was given time to restore itself, and by the last time period there was less than half the potential waste released",
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"I chose the highest amount of economic benefit possible, right before the water quality of the lake plummeted.",
,,I,,,T,,4b,"I wanted to keep the water quality from dropping rapidly, while stilling allowing for economic benefit.",
,,I,,,,,5a,"I released more waste in the first period, and less in the second. I tried to keep both aspects as high as possible without the other dropping.",
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy to avoid one aspect becoming very low. I wanted to keep the water quality high enough while still producing some economic benefit.,
,,I,,,T,,6a,"I tried to position the sliders in a way that would cause the most economic benefit without destroying the quality of the lake. I paid attention to which slider made the water quality drop without increasing economic benefit that much, and which benefitted the economy without harming the water too much.",
,,I,,,C,,6b,"I used the strategy in order to decide upon the best option for both aspects, so that both the economy and the water would benefit.",
,,I,,,T,,7a,I was trying to find the amount of waste that would maximize the three aspects. I was more focused on ensuring that the water would not be permanently algae-ridden.,
,,I,S,Am,S,,7b,"I used this strategy because if the lake is permanently unusable, people might move out and then the economic benefit would not even be as important. ",
,,I,,,C,,8a,I was trying to position the sliders so that the three aspects were maximized. ,
,,I,,,C,,8b,"Again, I was more focused on the water quality and reliability, so I tried to maximize economic benefit. I positioned them so that the water quality and reliability were not low, and economic benefit was still decent.",
,,I,S,,T,,9a,"My strategy was to increase all of the sliders until I saw no more economic benefit, only environmental  harm.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,I wanted to maximize economic benefit without doing considerable harm to the water.,
240131,b,I,,O,C,,1a,Initially I wanted to get some economic benefits to the town while still trying to keep waste low.,
,,I,,,,,1b,To better the town ,
,,I,,O,,,2a,I think if we release more waste in the first 50 years then maybe they will come up with alternative solutions in the next 50 years.,
,,I,,,,,2b,To maintain economic benefits in the short run,
,,I,,,,,3a,I wanted to release more waste in the first years and decrease it less and less each of the three periods.,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,I think this will be good for the economy and also reduce the waste that is going in at the same time.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I wanted high economic benefits while still trying to keep water quality good.,
,,I,,,,,4b,I used this because although the water eliminates waste on its own i still did not want to overload it with waste,
,,I,,Am,,,5a,more economic benefits in the short run so that we have time to build new businesses to get economic benefits elsewhere,
,,I,,Am,,,5b,to keep economic benefits high initially while we are looking for a solution to the water quality issue,
,,I,,,,,6a,more waste as the years go on ,
,,I,,Am,,,6b,maybe in the coming years the waste will be more environmentally friendly,
,,I,,,,,7a,try to keep waste down,
,,I,,Am,,,7b,natural waste is unreliable we can try to find economic benefits in a different way,
,,I,,Am,,,8a,less waste initially to see how much natural waste there is,

,,I,,,C,,9a,keep water quality and economic benefits high,
,,I,,,,,9b,to benefit the town,
240132,c,,,,,,1a,I chose to go with a number not too high and not too low. ,
,,I,,O,,,1b,I chose an option that did not have much risk.,

240133,d,I,,,,,1a,Maximize A,
,,I,S,,,,1b,Becuase higher amounts of A were desired,
,,I,,,,,2a,Maximize the inputs,
,,I,S,,,,2b,This maximized A,
,,I,,,,,3a,Maximize inputs,
,,I,S,,,,3b,This maximized A,
,,I,,,C,,4a,Maximize A and B,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"Since the drop off on B occurred right after 2 switched to 3, I chose right before the drop occurrred",
,,I,,,C,,5a,Maximize A and B,
,,I,,,C,,5b,"A went up with period 1, and B went down with period 2, so I tried to maximize both",
,,I,,,C,,6a,Maximize A and B,
,,I,,,,,6b,A seemed to move with period 1 and B seemed to move inversely with period 2,
,,I,,,C,,7a,Maximize A B and C,
,,I,,,T,,7b,"There seemed to be a drop off between 2 and 5, where B and C were quite high and A was low, but then a smaller increase in A led to a detrimental loss in B and C",
,,I,,,C,,8a,Maximize A B and C,
,,I,,,,,8b,A seemed to increase with period 1 while B and C seemed to decrease with Period 2,
,,I,,,C,,9a,Maximize A B and C,
,,,C,,C,,9b,I tried putting all 3 in the middle because it was hard to try and find a pattern here,
240134,c,,S,,,,1a,i looked at how much of an increase there was between 9-10 and moved accordingly,
,,I,C,O,,,1b,"something didnt seem right about having 10 completely, so i went just below",
,,I,,O,,,2a,maximize without using too much,

,,I,,Sd,C,,5b,so that too much of one of the other wouldnt be used+,
,,I,,,C,,6a,keep a and b equal,
,,I,,,C,,6b,to not make one or the other too much higher or lower,
,,I,,,S,,7a,try to get at least two of the 3 to be in the right direction without taking away from the other too much,

240136,b,I,,O,C,,1a,balance needs of factory and town,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,seemed to benefit both parties fairly,
,,I,,,,,2a,seemed best decision,
,,I,,,,,2b,reduce amount of waste in the second half of 100 years ,
,,I,,,,,3a,eventually reduce amount of waste,
,,I,,,,,3b,seemed fair since waste was reduced from the company over time,
,,I,,,C,,4a,not harm water quality too much while still making economic profit,
,,I,,,C,,4b,a little more on economic benefit but still not overly harming quality of water,
,,I,,,C,,5a,balance needs of both parties ,
,,I,,,,,5b,"release less waste in beginning, then allow for more waste in second half",
,,I,,,,,6a,not harm water quality too much ,
,,I,,,,,6b,decreased amount of waste over time ,
,,I,,Am,,,7a,do not want chance of filtration system breaking,
,,I,,,,,7b,did not want too much algae,
,,I,,,,,8a,decrease amount of waste released over time while still making economic profit,
,,I,,,,,8b,did not want to harm lake too much,
,,I,,,,,9a,gradually decreased the amount of waste generated over time,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I used this strategy because I wanted to balance the needs of the town and account for the other waste being put into the lake,
240137,b,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize the economic rewards for the city by using the visual aid.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because the return on the economic return was greater than the rest of the examples.,
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to maximize the economic benefits by releasing as much waste as possible so the factory may produce more.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy since the goal of the project is so maintain the high standard of economic activity.,
,,,S,,,,3a,"Instead of choosing the highest setting on the bar, this time I chose to increase the waste in the first 30 years, slightly reduce the waste dumpage in the next 30 years, and significantly reduce the waste output in the last 30 years.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,"I used this strategy to combine both interests of maximizing economic profit and reducing waste. Concentrating on the first 60 years, and allowing the last 30 years to clean up the damage seems reasonable.",
,,I,S,,C,,4a,I chose this to stay in the middle of economic strategy and environmental cause.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I chose this to make sure both needs were being met.,
,,,,,,,5a,"after reviewing the example graphs, I was trying to alter the graph that had the closest result to what I was looking for.",
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy of altering numbers similar to my desired result so that both economic interest as well as environmental concern could be addressed.,
,,I,,,,,6a,I was trying to model my answers to reflect the example that showed that the point on the graph was more centered if the waste was released towards the end of the 100 year period instead of the beginning.,
,,I,S,,,,6b,I used this strategy because the example was not close to where the desired intersection between water quality and waste output was.,
,,I,,,,,7a,I was trying to minimize the waste by keeping the sentiment in mind that the lake might be ruined forever.,
,,I,S,,S,,7b,I used this strategy because monetary value has less of important that natural resources.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,I used this strategy to keep the waste levels low in the beginning of the hundred year period and increase waste output in the end to make up for any economic losses,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,I used this strategy because it satisfies the environmental desire of keeping waste levels low and make up for this by keeping output higher towards the end. This process averages itself out in the end.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,my strategy included trying to balance out the waste over split periods periodically increasing so that the both interests of economic activity and environmental production could be met.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,I used this strategy to meet the needs of the goals by protecting economic activity however while still paying attention to the environment,
240138,c,I,,,,,1a,"In essence, I was trying to get the maximum amount for A. ",
,,I,S,,,,1b,"In order to receive the highest amount for A, the bar had to be set to a maximum. ",
,,I,S,,,,2a,"In order to achieve full efficiency for A, I chose to put both sliders at max for both of the planning stages. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,"Since the use of the sliders has no cost, in order to achieve full efficiency, I chose to put both the sliders at a rate of 10. ",
,,I,S,,,,3a,Contracted all three sliders at a rate of 10 to achieve the maximum amount for A over the entire planning process. ,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"In order to achieve the optimal amount for A, all three sliders in all three periods had to be set at a rate of 10. ",
,,,,,C,,4a,I split the setting in the middle. 5/10 for both A & B. ,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"Since both A and B are desirable but the main point of the plan is not to make A higher at the expense of B, vice versa. I decided to split it down the middle leaving both A & B at optimal heights.",
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"In both periods, I decided to set them at a .5% level, giving both A & B an equal optimal ratio.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,The reason I chose this strategy is because its the most optimal/efficient way of dividing A & B without compromising either. ,
,,I,,Sd,C,,6a,"Trying to balance points A & B in all three stages. Therefor, I left all three settings right down the middle.",
,,I,S,Sd,C,,6b,"In order to not compromise either A or B, I decided to set the three bars at 5, keeping equal chances for both A & B. ",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"In order to keep A, B, & C at an optimal level, I decided to keep them at an equal setting of 5. ",
,,I,S,Sd,C,,7b,"Even though B & C are not related, they both are sub-parts of A, which in turn means, if I give any one of them attention, I compromise the other. To avoid unequal standings for A, B & C, I gave them all equal stand points. ",
,,I,S,Sd,C,,8a,"Since B & C are subparts of A and dependent on the score given to A. In order to keep A, B & C equal, I decided to give them 5 points throughout the planning phase. ",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"The point is to keep A, B, & C at optimal lengths without compromising either of them. In order to do that, I decided to split them down the middle. ",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"In order to keep all parties at an optimal level, I decided to give them a 5 over the entire planning stage. ",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"To keep them optimal, a,b & c must remain at constant pace. ",
240139,a,I,,,,,1a,I tried to have more than 70% economic benefit but not dump the max amount of the waste,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,"I used this strategy of not obtaining maximum economic benefit because my role is an environmental planner, not the factory owner. Even though success is measured on economic benefit, my values are supposed to be in the interest of the environment. So I wanted to be both successful economically while not harming the environment completely",
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,"I first figured out which time period provided the largest economic benefit per waste dumped. The first 50 years provided more economic benefit, so I used the max waste dumping in the first period. Since the second period did not provide as much economic benefit, the trade off for dumping is not worth it as much. I did not put the slider at max to preserve some of the environment over the 100 years",
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used the strategy that provided the most economic benefit per amount of waste dumped. The dumped waste is not constant over the 100 years though.,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"Again, I first determined which time periods provided the most economic benefit per amount of waste dumped. The first period provided the most economic benefit, then the second period, and then the third period. ",
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used the strategy of dumping all of the waste during the first two periods because they provided the most economic benefit. The third period was not dumping all of the waste because it did not provide as much economic benefit per amount of waste dumped.,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,I checked all of the levels of waste dumping to visualize the path of the line on the graph. I noticed that at 0.27 the graph the water quality would drop drastically while providing minimal additional economic benefit,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I wanted to find the place that maximized water quality and provided the least marginal economic benefit,
,,I,,,T,,5a,I charted the path of each slide separately and find if there were thresholds where one axis would decrease drastically without providing benefit for the other aspect,
,,I,S,,T,,5b,"I started with the first slider and saw after 0.35 the water quality fell sharply. After leave the first slider at 0.35, I moved the second slider to a place until the orange dot quickly dropped in water quality without much economic benefit",
,,I,,,T,,6a,"The first slide provided the most environmental benefit per economic benefit and each slider was worse for the environment. I wanted to push the first slider until there was a sharp drop in economic benefit, and then slide the second one until there was a sharp drop.",
,,I,,,,,6b,I wanted to make sure each slider was taking advantage of the most environmental benefit per unit of economic benefit.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I wanted to find a safe strategy that was moderate across all three aspects,
,,I,,,C,,7b,There was too much uncertainty to prioritize my decision and I did not want to be skewed towards one.,
,,I,S,,T,,8a,I found places in each slider where there were large jumps in any direction. I prioritized water quality and reliability. The second slider did not have much economic benefit per water quality,
,,I,S,,S,,8b,I wanted to prioritize water quality and reliability because the uncertainty makes me plan for a more long-term perspective,
,,I,S,,T,,9a,I found places where each slider moved sharply in any direction. Then I maximized each slider starting with the top one until the sharp drop. This helped to capture the maximum water quality and reliability per unit of economic benefit,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I prioritized water quality and economic benefit because the uncertainty made me want to have a long-term sustainability perspective.,
240140,d,I,,Sd,,,1a,I was trying to use the lowest amount of A possible.,
,,I,,Sd,,,1b,I want my A supply to last multiple rounds so I did not want to use a huge amount initially.,
,,I,,Sd,,,2a,"I tried to use more of A, but still not the majority of it.",
,,I,,Sd,,,2b,"I allowed more because I had 2 periods rather than 1, but still want to save it for more rounds. ",
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to increase A by its amount (plus some) per period.,
,,I,,,,,3b,"I was told that more A is desirable by period, so I tried to plan for that.",
,,I,S,,,,4a,I chose the option with the greatest amount of A.,
,,I,,,S,,4b,I assumed that more A or more B would be preferable as opposed to an equal amount of both.,
,,I,,Sd,C,,5a,I was trying to have high A for the first period and high B for the second period. ,
,,I,,Sd,C,,5b,"I wanted the two periods to compensate for one another. Period 1 had high A and low B, so Period 2 had low A and high B.",
,,I,,,S,,6a,I used medium A and low B.,
,,I,C,,,,6b,"I wanted to try something different. I do not know if my prior strategies were successful or not, so I decided to try something new. That would be not quite having a pattern.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,I chose to go with High A and High C.,
,,I,,,,,7b,The dot on the panel with variables A and C looked like strong placement.,
,,I,,,,,8a,My strategy was to show increasing amounts from period 1 to 2.,
,,,C,,,,8b,"I was not sure what to do, so there is not much strategy behind it. ",
,,,,,,,9a,I showed increasing amounts from period 1 to 2 to 3.,
,,,C,,,,9b,Not much strategy behind this decision.,
240141,b,,,,,,1a,"For this round I was trying to keep waste around 30%. When looking through the examples, I noticed greater increases in the orange region of the economic impact chart. ",
,,,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because I the results in the orange remained pretty central with 0.03 waste/year. ,
,,I,,,,,2a,I understood the simulation better this round. I decided to target mid-range economic benefits. I adjusted the first bar to where it had around 0.05 impact and made the second a little lower. ,
,,I,,,,,2b,"I did this because I thought it was important to make sure the town was in decent economic standing, while the company was able to continue to emit waste for half of a century.",
,,I,,,,,3a,My strategy for this round was to seek a high economic benefit for the first two parts and then a low one for the third.,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,"I used this strategy hoping that by the time the third wave is coming, the company, town, and river will all have found a solution to balance the three.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,My strategy was very similar to that of last rounds. I wanted to achieve economic benefits for 55 of the 100 years in hopes that a solution could be found. I also kept in mind the water quality to limit the algae.  ,
,,I,S,O,,,4b,I used this strategy because I thought it made sense in the short-term and long-term. ,
,,I,S,,,,5a,My strategy was to try to ween the company off of producing waste by the second half of the 100 years.,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"I used this strategy because I considered all three elements: the factory, the lake, and the city. The factory must run to make the town run, therefore the economic benefits must remain positive, all while not hurting the ecosystem within the lake by maintaining trash. ",
,,,S,,,,6a,"This round, my strategy was to have the factory produce above average waste at 0.07 to start and then my the end of the century get that down to 0.03. ",
,,I,,,,,6b,"Instead of taking a short-term, immediate approach, I thought long-term. In order to reduce waste production into the lake, everyone must come up with a plan. ",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,My strategy for this round was to keep the water pollution and the economic benefits at medium levels.,
,,I,S,,S,,7b,"I used this strategy because I considered the risk in reliability and thought if it wasn't considered before, it doesn't have to be now",
,,I,,,C,,8a,My strategy for this round was to keep the economic benefits high with some reliability and then lower the water contamination over time. ,
,,I,,O,,,8b,I used this strategy because as an environmental planner I wanted to instill a gradual change. One that would not necessarily crumple the town's economy.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"For this strategy, I followed that of prior rounds. I went for high economic benefits at first followed by lower water contamination in later years. ",
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I used this strategy because I thought that as an environmental planner, with the town and the lake in mind, I needed to find a way to balance the impacts of all three. Maybe a strategy can be found down the road to fix the water contamination in the lake. ",
240142,c,I,,,,,1a,"I was trying to have a high amount of A, but not too high. ",
,,I,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because I felt as though it was a good amount high of a. ,
,,I,S,,,,2a,My strategy for this plan was to make sure to increase A throughout the two periods. I put the most time into period 1 and then less into period two to increase A.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"I used this strategy because I noticed that period 1 had the most impact on A, so I really wanted to maximize it. I realized that period two did not affect A as much, so i did not maximize it as much. ",
,,I,,,,,3a,"Again, I had period 1 have the highest strength, and then for period 2 and 3, I gave them the same strengths. ",
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used this strategy because period 1 had the biggest impact on A right away and then for period 2 and 3 they did not have as much as an impact on A so I reduced them. ,
,,I,,,S,,4a,I used the strategy of having a high amount of B and a lower-medium amount of A. ,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I used this strategy because I felt as though it maximized both A and B to the best of their ability. ,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to get both A and B to some type of equilibrium. ,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy because I felt as if I could maximize both A and B by making them semi-equal. ,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I tried to make A and B equal by playing around with the sliders. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I used this strategy because I wanted them to both be maximized.  ,
,,I,S,,,,7a,I chose a sem-high level of A. ,
,,I,,,,,7b,I used this strategy because I felt as though it maximized the materials best. ,
,,,S,,C,,8a,I gave period two a higher strength than period 1 to make the dot go somewhere in the middle.,
,,I,,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy because I was trying to maximize A, B, and C to the best of my ability. ",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I used the strategy of trying to find a midway point between A, B, and C to maximize them all to the best of my ability.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I used this strategy because I wanted to maximize A, B, and C all at once without hurting one more than the other. ",
240144,a,I,,O,,,1a,I weight the economic benefit slightly more than the environmental waste. ,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,"I am trying to balance the economic benefit with the environmental pollution, with considering the efficiency deal with the waste in the future. ",
,,,,,,,2a,I drag the slider of the first period to the extreme and do not produce anything in the second period.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,I saw that this strategy produce more economics benefits compared to draw the half way in both period in terms of the same pollution level. ,
,,,,,,,3a,I drag the first slider to the extreme and little bit right on the second period and nothing on the third period.,
,,I,,,,,3b,The bar of economic benefit tell me that it may be the optimal strategy. ,
,,I,,,,,4a,I am try to play wit the bar to see which combination give me the higher indifference curve. ,
,,I,S,,,,4b,Because it seems that it is the optimal strategy,
,,I,S,,,,5a,"Once you more the bar, the water quality with drop dramatically. Therefore, i discovered that give that water quality, increasing the economic will not harm the water quality further. So I drag both bar to the extreme.",
,,I,S,,,,5b,Because it seems that it gives me the optimal solution. ,
,,I,,,,,6a,I try to figure out the optimal combination using the bar,
,,I,S,,,,6b,It seems that it gives me the optimal output. ,
,,,,,C,,7a,I am try to figure out the balance by moving the bar,
,,I,S,,,,7b,It seems that it gives me the optimal output. ,
,,I,,,,,8a,"Given the first bar unmoved, I am try to move the second bar to estimate the optimal outcome by comparing those three variable.",
,,I,S,,,,8b,It seems that it gives me the optimal output. ,
,,,,,,,9a,I am controlling the two variable and trying to move the first bar. ,
,,I,S,,,,9b,It seems that it gives me the optimal output. ,
240145,d,I,,,,,1a,Have the highest number of A generated.,
,,,,D,,,1b,"Whenever I was moving the slider, the output was always 0,10,2,3,7,1.",
,,I,,,,,2a,Generate the highest number for A,
,,,,D,,,2b,I had the same issue as the first scenario where whenever I moved the sliders the output would not change.,
,,I,,,,,3a,Generate the highest number for A.,
,,,,D,,,3b,Output is not changing whenever I move the sliders.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,Generate the highest output of both B and A.,
,,,,D,,,4b,"Again, the output is not changing as I move the slider, so I am putting it in the middle.",
,,I,,,C,,5a,Generate the highest output of both A and B.,
,,,,D,,,5b,The location of the slider is not changing the output.,
,,I,,,C,,6a,Generate the highest output of both A and B.,
,,,,D,,,6b,The location of the slider is not changing the output.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,"Maximize output for A, B, and C.",
,,I,S,,S,,7b,I chose period 2 because it maximized output for B and C. It had the highest general output.,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"Maximize output for A, B, and C.",
,,I,S,,,,8b,I chose peiod 2 and 3 because 1 and 2 had high B and C and it looked as though the dot was trending toward a high A as well.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"Maximize output for A,B, and C",
,,I,S,,,,9b,"I chose 2,3,2 because 1,2,1 it already had high outputs for B and C and I thought if I slightly increased them that A would increase too.",
240146,a,I,,,,,1a,"place the waste at 70%, as well as the economic benefit at 70%",
,,I,,,,,1b,"I was trying to save some waste from the factory, because if go to full production, the environment might not be a best place to earn future profit, and some space for the economic growth, so that the factory may also be benefit from economic innovation in the future",
,,,,,,,2a,"have more waste/economic benefit for 1st half, while less for second half.",
,,I,,O,,,2b,"the small town business need more growth at the beginning, to gain a stable customer and let the community be ware, so after a relative fast growth, the factory can slow down the production with machine repair, introduce new equipment and wait for environment to restore.",
,,I,,,,,3a,"relative large waste for 1st, lower for 2nd and the largest for the 3rd",
,,I,,O,C,,3b,"the factory is on a relative large waste production, to gain a large economic benefit as startup, and slow down for restoration, and then boost for the last few year to get a higher economic benefit with the environment being ready to get more waste",
,,I,,,S,,4a,keep water quality as high as possible,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"since I'm an environmental planner, the first thing I need to think about tis the environment, the environment has its own pace of keep waster itself safe and clean, as I move the bar, the dot had a great fall once the waster go over 0.027 per year, after that, the economic benefit keep raising while the water quality keeps at a low rate. without the lake that can take the waster, the economic will going bad eventually, and no one would like to work for the company/factory.",
,,,,,,,5a,"more in 1st half, less in2nd half",
,,I,S,,T,,5b,"as moving the bar, I see that the economic benefit not changing much when the first half of period's water being high and benefit being low, as I put the second half waste down, and moving the first half bar forward I see the change in economic benefit had some jump; since the water remain low, the factory need to get more economic benefit as possible.",
,,,,,,,6a,"only have 1st being waste releasing , and minimum for last two",
,,I,S,,,,6b,"as I see from the graph, only the first bar would make a big difference on the economic benefit vs. water waste, while the last two bar did not change significantly; if I keep water quality at optimal in the 1st bar, the economic change still small while also have a bad water quality, so only produce waste in the 1st, to gain more economic benefit.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,keep economic benefit and water quality at high level,
,,I,S,,T,,7b,"the reliance has a huge fall once move the bar, so the optimal is to keep water and economic benefit at a relatively high level, since reliance is also unpredicatable",
,,I,,,C,,8a,"keep reliability and economic benefit at middle range, and water at a high level",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"the waste is not release at a very high level to keep factory run and water clean, and also get above- middle benefit",

,,I,,Sd,S,,9b,"trying to keep economic low and reliability & water quality high at the first two period, and then get a big economic benefit by sacrificing the reliability",
240147,c,,,,,,1a,I was just trying to get the orange bar as close as possible to the middle of A.,
,,,,,,,1b,I chose this strategy because the directions told me to manage A and I thought making the orange bar as close as possible to A would satisfy the goal.,
,,,,,,,2a,I was thinking of a way to get the orange bar as close as I can to A. ,
,,,,,,,2b,I chose this strategy because it didn't say to fill up the whole bar. ,
,,,S,,,,3a,I chose to fill up the bar all the way.,
,,,,,,,3b,I chose this strategy because I didn't think the meeting halfway was the right thing to do.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying to get in the middle of achieving the right amount of A and the right amount of B rather than getting a lot of only just one.,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I chose this strategy because I wanted to be able to balance both options rather than excelling in just one. ,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to get right in between the A and B.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I chose this strategy because I would like to be able to do both A and B rather than doing well in one and poorly in the other. ,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to find the middle of both A and B,
,,I,,,C,,6b,I chose this strategy because I wanted to be able to manage a somewhat equal amount of A and B,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I tried to achieve an equal amount for all three,
,,I,,,C,,7b,I chose this strategy because I wanted to be balanced.,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I just tried to get the orange dot as closely as I can to the end points of A and B. ,
,,I,,,S,,8b,I chose this strategy because it was nearly impossible to go up to C so I wanted achieve the maximum for A and B. ,
,,,,,C,,9a,I tried to get the orange ball and high and close to the end points of A and B.,
,,I,,,,,9b,I chose this Strategy because it seemed like that was the right thing to do,
240148,b,I,,O,C,,1a,I was thinking of just doing just enough so that the town will have economic benefits without polluting the lake too much.,
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"I used this strategy because as long as the town is thriving, there is no need to be greedy and adding more pollution to the lake.",
,,,S,O,C,,2a,My strategy is the same as last time. Go for the middle.,
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,I always go about half of the benefits because that will cause about half of the pollution.,
,,,S,,,,3a,"I decided to have a bit more than half of waste per year being let out the first 2 periods then in the last period, ill release less than half.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,"I use this strategy because it's important to start a good foundation for the economic benefit of the town then when it's established, we can lower the waste release because the town can survive from the well established economy.",
,,,S,,,,4a,I decided to release waste at 0.025 per year.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I used this strategy because that is where the equilibrium of water quality and economic benefit will be. At .02, the water quality is high but the economic benefit wasn't that high. at .03, the water quality dropped drastically for only a small increase in economic benefit so that's why I chose to release waste at 0.025",
,,I,S,,T,,5a,"I compared the examples and found the middle ground and decided whether the economic benefit was worth the degradation of the quality of water. I made the first period have more waste than the second period. After .5 waste per year in the second period, the water quality drops really fast so I believe that have less than .5 waste per year for the second period is the break-even point between economic benefit and water quality.",
,,I,S,,T,,5b,I used this strategy because a small increase in the economic benefit is not worth the big drop in water quality.,
,,,S,,,,6a,I kept the waste below .5 at all three periods.,
,,I,S,,T,,6b,"In all three periods, if the waste produced is at .5 or above, the water quality drops and that trade off is not optimal.",
,,,S,,,,7a,I decided to produce waste at a lower rate than the equilibrium ,
,,I,,,,,7b,I used this strategy because I do not know how much natural waste is being produced so I should keep the artificial waste production to a minimum.,
,,,S,,,,8a,I kept the waste production low. First period was at .01 and the second period was at .02,
,,I,,,,,8b,I used this strategy because the natural waste production is unknown so I do not want to risk making the lake permanently unenjoyable.,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,I chose an amount of waste production that allowed the water quality to stay high but also earn a reasonable amount of economic benefit.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,I used this strategy because I want to keep the water quality high but I still want to prevent a low economic benefit.,
240149,b,I,,,,,1a,"I was trying to maximize economic benefit, so I followed the linear pattern of more waste = more economic gain.",
,,I,S,,,,1b,"The only thing I had to care about in this one was the economic benefits, so I chose to maximize waste, which in turn maximized economic benefit.",
,,P,S,,,,2a,"My measure of success was once again only quantified in terms of economic benefit, so I sought to maximize that.",
,,P,S,,,,2b,"If the goal was only to maximize economic gain, there was no reason to worry about environmental damage, so I maxed out both wastes to create as much profit as possible.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I am once again acting solely to create as much economic benefit as possible.,
,,P,,,,,3b,"The only mention of a goal in this section is economic benefit, so I wanted to maximize output for the factory.",
,,I,,,,,4a,I am trying to minimize the decrease in either water quality or economic gain if the slider were changed.,
,,I,,,T,,4b,"There was a large drop off in water quality from .2 to .3, whereas there was not as much of a drop off in economic gain so I sought to find the true middle ground.",
,,I,,,T,,5a,"Trying to keep both as high as possible while keeping comparative advantages of each at a minimum. Trying to avoid if one was raised any higher, the other would fall by too much. ",
,,I,,,C,,5b,"It seemed that at a certain point based on the info, that the .7 49-99yr plan lowered the water quality by too much, so I stuck with the .5 in that regard, but chose to increase slightly the waste from the previous example, as it looked like economic benefit could increase without harming the lake too much more.",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,I'm sticking with about .025 as the amount that maximizes both water quality and economic output without harming the other too drastically. ,
,,I,,,T,,6b,"The examples so far have given me evidence to believe that .05 is much too risky, and .02 is not risky enough to give maximum outputs to each. Additionally, between .02 and .03 seems to be the largest drop off for water quality, so cutting that in half may be the best way.",
,,I,C,,C,,7a,"Trying to maximize all three variables without harming another too much. The examples were hard to read as the point was all over, so I sort of had to ballpark what information I thought it was attempting to show me",
,,I,C,,C,,7b,"I went with my gut on this one, after viewing a few examples hoping to find a stable middle ground for all three, even though the yellow point was kind of all over the graph which made it difficult to understand",
,,,,,,,8a,"I saw the dot format was different, the yellow one was unimportant and I could use the gray ones to figure out where each coordinate the plan would fall into for two variables at a time. ",
,,,,,C,,8b,I chose to ballpark where the gray dot would be most moderate for each of the three 2-axis graphs.,
,,I,,,C,,9a,Again hoping to find a fair middle ground for all three variables that didn't lower any one specifically.,
,,I,,,C,,9b,"It seemed smart to lowball my estimate of how much waste could be released given the variable nature of natural waste. I stuck near my gut estimate of .025-.03 for each year, allowing more in one section just to be fair to the factory.",
240151,c,I,,,,,1a,"I was trying to maximize the amount of ""A"" that was generated.",
,,P,,,,,1b,The instructions stated that a higher A was the desirable goal.,
,,I,,,,,2a,"Again, I was trying to maximize the level of A.",
,,,S,,,,2b,A was at its highest point when both sliders were switched to 10.,
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to  maximize the level of A that was reached over the three periods.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"A was at its highest when all three sliders were switched to 10. The use of the sliders were unrestricted and had no cost, therefore it did not seem unreasonable to maximize the level of all three to level 10.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying to maximize both A and B without making one substantially worse.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I noticed that there is a substantial jump between notch 2 and 3 on the slider. B levels at from 3 on. After 3, A gets higher but B levels out at an extremely low level. Notch 2 is the only place where B is not loosing a lot with at least a little upside for A. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to maximize both A and B without making one substantially worse.,
,,I,S,,T,,5b,"I noticed that there is a substantial jump between notch 2 and 3 on the slider. B levels at from 3 on. After 3, A gets higher but B levels out at an extremely low level. Notch 2 is the only place where B is not loosing a lot with at least a little upside for A. ",
,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to maximize both A and B without making any outcome any worse.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I found that this created high outcomes for both A and B with little to no worsening of the outcomes for either. The instructions did not specifically say that any of the sliders have to be notched higher than zero.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I was trying to maximize A, B, C without creating too much downside risk.",
,,I,,,C,,7b,"The higher B and C means a lower A. However, a higher A means both a lower B and C. All three values are equally desirable, therefore by having a lower A, although you are losing A, you are creating more upside potential with the other two values. If I did the opposite, I would only have upside potential on A and losing value on both B and C, creating more downside, negative outcomes. ",
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I was trying to maximize the three values of A,B and C without creating too much downside risk or outcomes.",
,,I,,,S,,8b,"Similar to the previous decision, I figured it would be better to maximize both B and C by taking a lower value with A. A still reached a mid-grade outcome while B and C were almost completely maximized. ",
,,I,,,C,,9a,I was trying to maximize the three values without creating too much downside risk.,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,"The point I chose was the highest point I could make A, while B and C were little to no value.",
240152,a,I,S,O,C,,1a,"with keeping the waste on the lower end of the spectrum, I decided to push it closer to the middle so that there was still economic benefits",
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"This will result in low waste, but with reasonable economic benefit",
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,I decided to keep the waste for the first 50 years to show we are listening and caring about our community's wishes. The next fifty years I increased the amount of waste to ensure we will still be economically stable and profitable.,
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,"We were satisfy out community by doing this while still being profitable. The next fifty years the factory will become even more successful. Also, the wishes of our community members might change after 50 years.",
,,I,,O,C,,3a,"I am trying to satisfy the communities wishes immediately while also still ensuring the factory economic benefit. Overtime, I will increase the waste each year to maintain the factory's growth and be able to support the community.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,"This will again satisfy our community's wishes right away. Their wishes could potentially change over the years, which is why I increased the waste each period. The factory will continue to become more successful over this 100 year period.",
,,I,S,,S,,4a,Once the waste level got 0.028 the quality of the water decreased rapidly and it didn't get much worse as economic benefit increased. Therefore I decided to drag the cursor towards in favor of economic benefits.,
,,I,S,Am,S,,4b,"With the success of the factory, new research and development could be done on the lake's current cleaning process. Therefore, I decided to put the factory's success at the forefront of my priorities because of the fact the water quality didnt get much worse after a certain point as I dragged my cursor down the line.",
,,I,S,Am,C,,5a,"I decided to do less waste the first fifty years to keep the quality of the water as best we can without damaging the factory success. Then, in the next fifty years we will be able to spend money on some R& D to figure out a quicker way to process the waste out of the lake.",
,,I,S,Am,C,,5b,I believe this is a good approach and will satisfy everyone. It shows the factory cares about their community and its environment and knows they are doing something bad to the lake. They will be able to tel the community they will research better ways to keep it clean with the success of the company over the last fifty years.,
,,I,S,Am,C,,6a,"I used the same approach to increase the waste after each period. This will keep the lake in good shape for the first 66 years. By year 67, the factory wil have a new cleansing process to implement into their community lake.",
,,I,S,Am,C,,6b,"I believe the factory will continue to succeed. They will earn respect from the government and their community by putting some research into new processes. Overall, the will have good economic benefit and be able to find new ways and implement to keep the lake clean while still being able to function as a business.",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,I found a good spot to satisy all aspects. The quality of water will remain high even with economic benefits remaining high.,
,,I,S,Am,C,,7b,"I believe this will work. Again, with high economic benefit they will be able to research more about the waste problme in the lake.",
,,,,,,T,8a,it deletred mt answers three timeds,
,,,,,,T,8b,n/a,
,,I,,,S,,9a,i put reliability on the lowest of my priorities. ,
,,I,S,Am,,,9b,"I used this strategy because it reslted in extremely high success and quality of water. With the success, we can fund R&D projects to get a better grip of the quality of the water. We can figure out new ways to keep it clean and better manage the waste entering the lake.",
240153,d,,,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize the amount of A in my plan by estimating the amount of A I would receive based upon the examples given.,
,,,,,,,1b,I used this strategy because the amount of A listed in the examples seemed to be positively correlated to the slider position. ,
,,I,,,,,2a,Maximize the amount of A by choosing the 2 slider positions that seemed most favorable by observing the examples given.,
,,,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy because in the examples listed the higher the slider positions the higher the amount of A,
,,I,,,,,3a,Maximize the amount of A by making the best choice of plans based on the examples provided,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I used the same strategy as previously used because the sliders position and the amount of A were positively correlated again. Higher slider position, higher A.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,Trying to come up with and optimal amount of A and B while causing minimal damage to both A and B as goals by observing the examples and choosing an estimate that balances the two.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I chose this strategy because the optimum output should be a combination of A and B since too much A causes less B and we are trying to maximize the combined output.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,Trying to find the optimal output of A and B by choosing a slider position based on the examples given. ,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy because based on the examples it seemed that higher and lower levels of the sliders tended to result in outcomes that were less than ideal. So I went towards the middle of the sliders to estimate a more positive outcome.,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,Maximize the amount of A and B by finding the point on each slider that results in the highest combined outcome by looking at the examples given.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"I went towards the middle of each slider as the examples indicated, in my opinion, that those positions would result in a more even distribution and higher outcome",
,,I,,,S,,7a,"Trying to maximize A, B, and C by looking at the examples and choosing a slider position that seemed to create a favorable outcome. By keeping A on the smaller side B and C are higher leading to higher output.",
,,,,,,,7b,I used this strategy because based on the examples it seemed that the slider position around 2 generated a good outcome.,
,,I,C,,C,,8a,"Trying to choose the best combination of A, B, and C based on the examples in the graph (which I think I understand now).",
,,,,,,,8b,I used this strategy because the graph gives some examples and when manipulating the sliders to estimate where the outcomes would fall I chose the optimal output. ,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"Find a point on the sliders that provides a reasonable amount of A, B, and C by using the examples and estimating the effects of each slider.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I used this strategy to develop estimates of the ""middle"" ground on the slider that would provide amounts of A, B, and C that would be considered reasonable.",
240154,c,,,,,,1a,"I was trying to maximize the amount of orange in the box, so I tried several options until I found the largest amount possible.",
,,,S,,,,1b,The cost of usage was unrestricted so I knew I could adjust as many times as needed to find the best option.,
,,,,,,,2a,"Same scenario as the first, trying to maximize the amount of orange in the bar. I used the same strategy as the first just with two sliders.",
,,,S,,,,2b,It worked on the last one and the same rules applied to this scenario.,
,,,C,,,,3a,Trying to maximize the orange in the graph. This is starting to seem unusual to me since the directions given to me are not necessarily the same as what is on my screen. I was expecting an orange dot instead of this bar graph.,
,,,,,,,3b,I used it because it has been the same as the previous two scenarios.,
,,,,,T,,4a,"I was trying to find the option where I could achieve the largest total value combining A and B, so I tested a bunch of different options and noticed an enormous drop-off in value of B from 2.7 to 2.8. Since the value of B only decreased more after that, 2.7 seemed the best to me.",
,,I,,,,,4b,"I used this strategy partially on instinct since it felt right to me, but I could also tell the amount of value for B at higher sliders was less than the value of A at lower ones.",
,,,,,T,,5a,"I started by using the first slider to try and find the same huge drop-off that was in the last one. Once I found that, I toyed with the bottom slider until I found what I thought was the optimal position.",
,,,,,,,5b,"I tried using both sliders as much as possible but it seemed higher values just kept decreasing the value, so I used my experience from the last one to help me.",
,,,C,,,,6a,I was trying to test various options to find the optimal point. The third slider was very volatile so it took me some time to figure out what I thought was best. The first two sliders seemed to act the same as the last experiment so I left them in their previous locations.,
,,,S,,,,6b,Using my past decision to set the first two was the quickest way and it worked before so I figured it would work the same again.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I was trying to find a spot that minimized the trade-off between increasing A and decreasing B & C.,
,,I,S,,T,,7b,"I chose the spot I did because anywhere after my point would greatly decrease the value of B and C. Since they are all highly valued, I would rather have two high value points than just one by increasing A. I gain more overall value this way.",
,,I,S,,T,,8a,"This time I independently looked at each slider to see how they reacted. Slider 1 was highly responsive and affected values greatly, where slider 2 was less responsive. I found the optimal point for 2 and then incrementally adjusted 1 up since it was so volatile until it started to drop value off.",
,,,,,,,8b,"I used this because I didn't want to rely on past experiences again, I thought there might be a better way to find the optimal value.",
,,I,S,,T,,9a,"I used the method from last time to see how volatile the sliders were. 3 was even less volatile than the other two, so I maximized that, kept the second one lower, and the first one the lowest to lessen the impact of B and C being decreased drastically.",
,,,,,,,9b,This strategy seemed to work better than the relying on my past experiences method so I decided to try it again.,
240155,b,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to find a happy medium between the economy and the environment.,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,"I wanted the lake to retain its integrity, while also not allowing the town's economy to plummet. ",
,,I,,O,C,,2a,"I wanted to make sure that the economy at least increased by half, while also keeping the water as clean as possible.",
,,I,,O,,,2b,"The economy can't be left in shambles after the first 50 years, and perhaps, in the future, we will have a better way of eliminating waste. ",
,,I,,O,C,,3a,Trying to keep the economy as high as possible while eliminating the most waste.,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,"I wanted to keep the integrity of the water for the citizens, but also make sure that the financial situation over time would not be a crisis. ",
,,I,,Sd,C,,4a,I wanted to keep the bar somewhat in the middle so it is about equal for both the waste and the economy.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"This way, the lake isn't entirely ruined, and the economy hasn't entirely shrank. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to make the water quality as high as it could be without ruining the economy. ,
,,I,,,C,,5b,"I used this because the lake will still be enjoyable, and hopefully, if you decrease the waste over time, it will allow the economy to remain stabilized.",
,,I,,,C,,6a,"I was trying to make sure that they were balanced for the first third, decrease waste the second third, and then bring it back up on the third.",
,,I,,,,,6b,"I wanted to give the lake some time to rejuvenate during the time of the second third, and then allow for the mechanism in the lake to take a break and then come back stronger next time. ",
,,I,,,,,7a,I wanted to make sure that the lake was not getting as much waste because there are more wastes contributing to the integrity of the lake. ,
,,I,,,C,,7b,"I didn't want to completely ruin the lake, but also wanted  there to be some benefit in the economy. ",
,,I,,,,,8a,I was trying to eliminate as much algae as possible. ,
,,I,,,,,8b,I want the people of the town to be happy and not completely destroy the lake. ,
,,I,,,,,9a,I was trying to make sure that the algae did not take over the lake.,
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I do not want the town to be unhappy or the lake to be taken over, but i also want the economy to do slightly well. ",
240156,a,I,S,,,,1a,Since this scenario asked you to maximize the economic benefit of the factory you would simply have the maximum amount of waste released per year to achieve the highest economic benefit,
,,P,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because the goal given was the maximization of economic benefit,
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,Trying to maximize economic benefit. The years 0-49 had the most effect on economic benefit so it seemed to make more sense to produce more waste in those beginning years and then significantly cut back on the amount of waste for years 50-99 because there was much less economic benefit,
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,I used this strategy because putting more and more waste into the lake with a much lower economic benefit didn't make sense when you need this lake to survive. Therefore I significantly cut down on the waste in years 50-99 to preserve the lake as there wasn't much economic benefit from polluting it,
,,I,S,O,C,,3a,My strategy was to create the most waste when we would receive the most economic benefit. In the first 33 years you receive the most benefit so we would generate the most waste then. Then in the next 33 years we cut the waste created in half and again for the last of the years cut it in half. ,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,I used this strategy to try to maximize the amount of economic benefit received from the factory but also ensuring that the lake wouldn't be completely destroyed by waste,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,My strategy was to find a balance between high water quality and economic benefit. I found that above .27 waste/year the water quality significantly drops off to only then increase economic benefit.,
,,I,,,C,,4b,"Because preservation of the lake's water quality was important I wanted to find the balance of the highest water quality with the most economic benefit, leading me to settle on .27 waste/year",
,,I,,,C,,5a,Strategy was to try and strike a balance maintaining a decent water quality and also getting economic benefits from the factory. I tried to find a point at which water quality didn't suffer too much but there was still some economic benefit,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy to both maintain economic benefits and to maintain water quality in the lake over time,
,,I,,,S,,6a,This time I tried to focus more on the economic benefits over the water quality. I allowed for a much lower standard in water quality and then tried to maximize the amount of economic benefit while keeping that standard of water quality.,
,,I,,,S,,6b,I had been mostly focused on the preservation of water quality which was limiting the economic benefits that could be received so I decided to implement a strategy to see how much economic benefit could be gained by caring less about the environment.,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I was trying to find a balance between the economic benefits received from the factory and the water quality and reliability of the lake. I wanted to find a balance that would allow for benefits from the factory without compromising the lake.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,I chose this strategy to try to ensure the lake would not become permanently overrun by algae but that the factory would still provide some benefits,
,,I,S,,S,,8a,"My strategy was to maintain the integrity of the lake and worry less about the economic benefit, in order to ensure that lake was still functional. I did ensure that there was some economic benefit from the factory still.",
,,I,,,S,,8b,There will be no benefits of the factory if everyone leaves once the lake is destroyed so I focused my strategy around ensuring the lake would survive,
,,I,,,S,,9a,My strategy was to maintain the lake's integrity but to allow for slightly less preservation of lake quality in order to try to maximize the economic benefits of the factory.,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I chose this strategy to ensure there was enough of an economy for the town to function but to also ensure the lake would not be destroyed,
250126,b,I,S,,,,1a,I set the bar to 0.07 so that I could have more of an economic advantage.,
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"I didn't want to completely kill the lake early on in the process, but making a good amount of money also sounded really nice, so I picked one of the higher amounts.",
,,I,,,,,2a,"I was trying to mimic one of the examples given to me but gain even more from it by increasing the waste level of the first bar, since there was one example that had .03 and .07 respectively, and then another example that was instead .07 and .03, which had a relatively higher economic advantage.",
,,I,,,,,2b,I wanted to gain a lot out of the factory.,
,,I,,O,C,,3a,"I was again mimicking one of the examples given to me, without completely killing the lake. ",
,,I,,,,,3b,"I think I noticed a pattern in the examples in that the earlier the waste occurs, the more economic advantage I receive. So I made the first bar the greatest, the second bar a little lower, and then the last bar the lowest. I did this because I believed that this would grant me the most money.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I was trying to get the bar between .02 and .03 since it looked the most ""in the middle""",
,,I,C,,C,,4b,"I used this strategy because I was trying to find a correlation/reasonable curve that the graph might have had, and I believed that the water quality and economic advantage would've been about the same around this number.",
,,,,,,,5a,I tried to make it very similar to one of the examples given,
,,I,,,C,,5b,"I used this strategy so that I could try to be as even as possible between the water quality and the economic advantage. I noticed that the example given was a little closer to one side though (water quality), so I moved one of the bars a little further along.",
,,I,,,,,6a,"Trying to go off of one of the examples once again, but lessening the environmental waste.",
,,I,,,C,,6b,"I did this because many of the examples given were closer to one side than the other, and I was trying to find one example that was the closest in the middle and then adjusting it to how I wanted to, so in this case, I lessened the environmental waste",
,,,,,,,7a,I was trying to be between .05 and .02,
,,I,,,C,,7b,"I used this strategy because I wanted it to be right in the middle of all three. Even though .05 was in between two of the choices, I didn't want reliability to be too low for the sake of the lake",
,,I,S,,C,,8a,one of the examples looked very close to the middle so I chose that one and adjusted a little bit,
,,I,C,,,,8b,"I did this because the 3-D graph is a little harder for me to read, so I wanted to be a little safer again for the sake of the lake, so my values for waste is relatively low.",
,,I,,,C,,9a,tried to go off of all of the graphs and find a happy medium,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I think I understood the graphs a little better this time so I was trying to get it equidistant from the center corner for all of the points. I also kept in mind that the economic benefit was not where I wanted it to be so I adjusted it so that hopefully I could get more money from it while keeping the water quality relatively in the same area,
250131,d,I,,D,,,1a,"I was trying to find a point on the slider where each of the 6 examples showed high, and consistent values for A.  I checked several points, and came to the conclusion that it does not matter which point I am at on the sliding bars the outcomes were all the same, so I just picked a point.",
,,P,,,,,1b,"I thought that there would be a certain ideal point where I would be guaranteed for A to be higher, and I would be able to successfully complete the task.",
,,,,,,,2a,This time I tried to mix and match as many levels as I could.  I also watched the totals of A in the upper corner.,
,,I,,D,,,2b,"I still found that all of the levels of input were the same, but I thought maybe there was one magic combination for maximum A.",
,,I,,,,,3a,"This time I just chose values, with the idea that if I started off managing a lot and slowly backed off, there could be benefits.",
,,I,,D,,,3b,"I tested a few different levels, but once I concluded that it didn't matter what I chose because all of the outcomes are the same, I just arranged the sliders in a way that I could justify. ",
,,,,D,,,4a,"This time, I looked at each example and moved the slider while looking at each example; the value on the slider still appeared to make no difference.",
,,I,,D,,,4b,I wanted to see if the total values of A would respond at all to changes in the level on the slider.  I saved on the screen with the optimal level because I hoped that that is the example that actually happens,
,,,,,,,5a,"I saved on the screen that had the outcome I wanted, and chose levels on the slider that I liked. ",
,,,,D,,,5b,"I have come to the conclusion that the sliders have no effect on the level of A, but I am concerned that if I submit a task without moving the sliders there will be negative repercussions.  ",
,,,,,,,6a,I thought that medium levels of output would be ideal. ,
,,,,D,,,6b,"Since the levels on the sliders don't matter to the level of A, I was not overly concerned with what the levels were. I checked a few points on the sliders just to be sure that this wasn't the task where everything changed. ",
,,,,D,,,7a,I chose example three. The sliders did not affect this at all!,
,,I,,,C,,7b,"It had low levels of A but high b and c, so two good things! the point was closest to the center of the graph.  ",
,,,,D,,,8a,"I figured that the sliders didn't do anything, since I tested them in every other round and this one.  So I chose slider levels, and saved on the desired outcome. ",
,,I,,,C,,8b,"Example 4 had higher levels of A, and also high levels of b and c, so I chose slider levels and saved there.  ",

",
,,I,C,O,C,,1b,"This was mostly a guess because I did not have the information to know how much the waste will affect the lake. I was only told about the economic benefits, making it a skewed decision.",

,,P,S,,,,2b,"After reading the directions more carefully and knowing I will be rewarded for the highest number of economic benefit and at this point it has nothing to do with the environmental benefit, I made the economic benefit as high as possible, even though I know it means the lake will be destroyed.",

,,P,S,,,,3b,"I know that I will be rewarded for the most economic benefit at the end of the study, and since at this point the environment is not a factor and I don't know how it is affecting the lake, I did not take it into consideration in my decision. ",
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"I was trying to keep the water quality as high as possible, with the most economic benefits. I noticed as I went from 0.027 to 0.028 the water quality drastically decreased and there was about the same amount of economic benefit. ",
,,I,S,,S,,4b,"As an biological engineer with a focus in natural resources, water quality is what I am planning to go in to. I did not feel comfortable with such a low quality of water for the economic benefits, so I tried to keep the water quality as high as possible.",

250163,b,I,S,,,,1a,My strategy was to find the right amount of waste to increase the economic benefits as much as possible.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy in order to maximize the economic benefits.,
,,I,S,,,,2a,"The economy increased more with more waste in the first 50 years and less waste in the second 50 years, so I maximized the waste of the first 50 years, and decreased the amount in the second 50 years.",
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,To maximize the economy while minimizing the amount of waste.,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"The production of waste in the last third did not do much to the economic benefits. The majority of the benefits fell in the first two thirds. Therefore I maximized the production of waste in the first two thirds. While there weren't many benefits in the last third, there will still some so I increased it just below half way.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,To maximize the economic benefits and minimize the production of waste.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,"0.02 increased the water quality a lot and decreased the benefits. 0.03 decreased the water quality and increased the benefits. Therefore, I knew I had to be somewhere in the middle. 0.025 would benefit the water more than the economic benefits. So I decided it must be between 0.025 and 0.03",
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I used this strategy to even the benefits and the water quality,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"The first year doesn't impact the water quality nearly as much as the second, so I maximized the first year's waste production. The second year harms the water quality way more than the first year so I minimized its waste production.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,My strategy was to find an even level between water quality and economic benefits.,
,,I,,,,,6a,"The second period seemed to affect the water quality the most so I minimized it, while maximizing the first. The third seemed to affect both at almost the same rate so I increased it slightly above half.",
,,I,S,,C,,6b,To maximize water quality and economic benefits.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"0.05 provided very minimal reliability, while 0.02 provided a little less benefits than we would like. Since the 0.02 was closer to making everything even, I chose 0.03",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,The maximize all three.,
,,I,S,,,,8a,"The waste production in the first year harmed the reliability more. So I minimized the waste production in the first year, but then had to increase it for the second.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,To maximize all three.,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"The second affected reliability the most so we wanted to minimize that. While the first and last helped with economic benefits, the first affected the water quality the most so we couldn't increase the first too much.",

,,I,S,,,,7a,"I moved the lever to see where the dot would move, but made sure to also take into account the natural waste.",
,,,,,,,7b,I used it to make sure that I would have maximum benefits,
,,,,,,,8a,I was trying to move the lever to see what was the best spot. ,
,,,,,,,8b,I used it to find the best place that would give me the best outcome. ,
,,,,,,,9a,I moved the lever until I found a spot that I was happy with,
,,,,,,,9b,To find a spot that would give me the best outcome,
250165,c,,,,,,1a,It said it was best to produce more of A so I slid the bar until it was near the top,
,,I,,O,,,1b,I used this strategy because with the information provided I thought it was best to make higher amounts of A but I didn't want to slide it all the way to 10,
,,,,,,,2a,It said the more A that was generated the better so I tried to get it to the top,
,,,,O,,,2b,I used this strategy because I thought to produce less in period 1 and more in period 2 because demand might rise,
,,,,,,,3a,I figured I would keep each one close to even this round,
,,,C,,,,3b,Honestly I don't know since there is little information provided I feel like it Is best to try different strategies ,
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I was trying to produce the most of each as possible but after around slider point 3, the more you produced A didn't really decrease the amount of B too much more.",
,,I,,,S,,4b,"Since it didn't have much affect on B at a certain point to produce more A, I figured it was better to have a lot of A and less of B rather than just a little bit but even amount of each",
,,I,,,C,,5a,i was trying to balance the amount of A and B that were produced,
,,I,,,S,,5b,"i tried to produce more of A because if you produce a lot of B, almost no A is produced but some of B can still be produced while making a moderate amount of A",
,,I,,,S,,6a,i tried to produce more of B and less of A in this round,
,,I,,,C,,6b,I used this stratregy because i got to a point where at least some of A was being produced with a lot of B,
,,I,,,C,,7a,i was trying to produce the most of each one ,
,,,,,,,7b,because it said higher amounts of A B and C are all desirable,
,,,,,,,8a,i was trying to produce the most of at least 2,
,,,,,,,8b,because they are all desirable to have more,
,,I,,,C,,9a,i was trying to produce a decent amount of each,
,,I,,,S,,9b,because it said all 3 were desirable but there were tradeoffs so one had to be generated less,
250166,d,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize A. I looked at all of the examples to see how much A was produced according to the number on the scale. It seems like if the number was 10 it maximized A.,
,,,,,,,1b,I used this strategy because I think using prior data and examples is a good way to make decisions if you do not have that much information.,
,,I,,,,,2a,I saw that the amount of A seemed to be only affected by the first slider bar so I set that one to 10 because it was the most A. I also set the second slider bar to 10.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy because I knew that in the examples they showed that the first slider made the decision on amount of A but I set the second to 10 too just in case because the example only had both slider bars at 10 so I think it was best to follow that example.,
,,,S,,,,3a,I put all three slider bars at 10.,
,,I,,,,,3b,"In the example, when all three slider bars were at 10, A was maximized.",
,,I,,,S,,4a,I the slider bar to 10 which made a high level of A and a low level of B.,
,,I,,,S,,4b,I wanted to choose one variable that would be maximized. I felt since people have different opinions on which is better that it would be more beneficial to have very high levels of at least one variable so you are efficient in that aspect instead of have mediocre levels of both A and B.,
,,I,,D,S,,5a,I set both slider bars to 10 because in the example it seemed like only the first bar had an affect on the graph. I wanted to maximize one variable which was A because the levers didn't seem to have an effect on B.,
,,I,,,S,,5b,"I set both slider bars to 10 because I knew that the first lever would have an effect on the graph but wasn't sure about the second. In the example, A was maximized when both levers were set to 10 so I decided to set both to 10 just in case.",
,,I,,,S,,6a,"I wanted to maximize one variable so I set all three levers to 10 because in the example, when all three levers were at 10, A was maximized.",
,,I,,,S,,6b,I wanted to maximize one variable instead of having moderate levels of both because people have different opinions on which is better so I would have everybody supporting me who thinks A is better instead of no one supporting me because the levels are moderate on both.,
,,I,C,,,,7a,I was confused by this decision. I couldn't tell what the level of C was. I wanted to choose a level where B and C were both high.,
,,I,,,S,,7b,I wanted B and C to both be high because they are unrelated so they would not have an inverse effect on one another and I can have high levels of two out of three variables.,
,,I,,,S,,8a,I wanted to maximize B and C.,
,,I,,,S,,8b,The graph when the levers were at 1 and 2 it seemed like B and C were both high. B and C are unrelated so I wanted to maximize both.,
,,I,,,S,,9a,Wanted to maximize B and C. Seemed like they were both high when the levers were in this position.,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,Better to maximize B and C because they are unrelated and I wanted high levels of two out of three variables.,
250167,a,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to create the most economic benefits for my company.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I maxed out waste because it would produce the greatest economic benefit for my company.,
,,I,,,,,2a,"Create more economic benefits (more waste) in the beginning 50 years, then taper off in the last 50 years.",
,,I,S,,,,2b,"Economic benefits is more important in the first few years of operation because without them, future business is not guaranteed.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,"Maximize economic benefits in the first third, then slowly taper off by 1/3 waste in the next two periods. ",
,,I,S,O,,,3b,"Same as before, except this time waste was divided so waste would be divided into three. Maximize economic benefits in the first period for a strong foundation because the same amount of waste does not produce as much benefit in later periods.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying not to lose out on too much economic benefits while also preserving the water quality.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I noticed that between 0.027 and 0.028, there is a significant difference between water quality for the same amount of economic benefit, with 0.027 having the much better water quality. Therefore it made sense to me that 0.027 is the golden number.",
,,I,S,,,,5a,Economic benefits in the first period are more important than the second period.,
,,I,,,,,5b,"I tried to preserve water quality in the first period like last time, but this time it seemed to make no difference how well it was preserved if the sacrifice was made for only one of the years because water quality was very sensitive to the waste -- a small change in waste caused a huge drop in quality. Thus, here it was not worth sacrificing economic benefits for.",
,,I,S,,S,,6a,Economic benefit was my focus for this decision.,
,,I,S,,S,,6b,"For the first year, economic benefits were most volatile, thus I set the waste level high; I would have set it to a lower number like 0.3 in year 1, but it seemed that even the slightest increase in waste for the second and third years would destroy the water quality. So, I focused on economic benefit in this case.",
,,I,,,T,,7a,"I was trying to find the point where little sacrifice in one variable will lead to a huge difference (for the better) in the other variables. Unfortunately, I had to sacrifice a lot of economic gain in this case, but it was for better reliability which is permanent, so I chose this number over the one right above it.",
,,I,,,S,,7b,"I chose this strategy because I weighed reliability as the most important variable. It was permanent consequences for everybody in the town, so that is why I based my decision mostly on how much I could maximize reliability. ",
,,I,,Sd,C,,8a,"I wanted to maximize reliability in the first set of years, and then maximize economic benefit in the second set.",
,,I,S,,T,,8b,"I used this strategy because reliability was my first priority, but after that it was about how much I could move along the economic benefits axis while limiting a drop in the reliability axis.",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I start from the first set of years before moving on to the others, in order. I try to find the point where I could gain a lot in one dimension without sacrificing too much in the other (here, the two variables that were important were reliability and economic benefits). This time, after finishing my choices for all three in order, I went back to adjust them again.",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"I chose this strategy because reliability is the first important thing to consider. After that, I adjusted the sliders such that I would gain the most economic benefits without sacrificing too much reliability.",
250168,c,I,S,O,C,,1a,I was trying to get the highest amount of A but not be completely at 10 on the slider bar.,
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"Higher values are better but looking at the paper graph example, the higher up has more waste/year.",
,,I,S,,,,2a,Have high values of A but have period 2 be a little higher than period 1,
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,To get high values of A but not have the bars all the way at 10 because of waste so somewhere a little past the middle,
,,I,,,,,3a,I tried to get A all the way to the top with a little variation in each period,
,,I,,,,,3b,I think A has to be the max it can go but without the slider bars being over,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,I found a spot where the orange ball is between A and B,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,2.8 was the value where A and B looked most even since they affect eachother,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to get the orange dot in the middle of A and B,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,At 3.3 and 1.9 the orange dot was in the middle of A and B,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to get the orange dot in between A and B,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"At 3.4, .2 and .7, the orange dot was in the middle of A and B",
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I was trying to get the orange dot in between A, B and C",
,,I,,Sd,C,,7b,Because all the letters affect each other but B and C don't so I was looking for something in the middle,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I was trying to get the orange dot in the middle between A, B and C",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,I didn't want A or B or C to be too high so I adjusted the bars until I found something where the orange dot looked like it was relatively in the middle,
,,I,,,,,9a,I wanted a high value of A but also had a lower value of C,
,,,,,,,9b,B and C don't relate,
250169,b,I,S,O,C,,1a,"Given the visualization of the data, I decided it would be beneficial to the town to keep the economic benefits of the factory in the top half of the bar. The 0.7 example seemed a bit too much waste for the lake, so I lowered it to 0.6 in an attempt to maximize benefit while minimizing waste.",
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"The 0.7 example seemed a bit too much waste for the lake, so I lowered it to 0.6 in an attempt to maximize benefit while minimizing waste.",
,,I,,O,C,,2a,"Attempting to keep above halfway while trying to minimize waste, but also trying to minimize waste in the long run.",
,,I,,O,C,,2b,As an environmental planner it should be my goal to reduce waste over time. At the same time I don't want this to reduce economic benefits. I raised the initial waste to 0.7 to compensate for the reduced half of the time frame.,
,,I,S,O,C,,3a,Maintain economic benefits while gradually reducing waste.,
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,reducing waste by .03 every 33 years (starting high to maintain the economy) seemed like a reasonable goal.,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,Prioritize water quality while trying to maximize economic benefits,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,I saw from the example that there was a sharp drop in water quality around 0.3 and that the quality from 0.0 to 0.2 from the same (high) and that the quality from 0.3 to 1.0 was the same (low). I assumed that the quality would be about halfway up around 0.25 on the sharp drop between 0.2 and 0.3. This was the maximum economic benefit achievable with a passing water quality.,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"Get maximum values for quality and benefits, prioritizing quality.",
,,I,,,C,,5b,the 0.5/0.2 example provided a near square for benefits and quality. As a environmental planner I wanted to give a slight priority to the lake so I lowered the 0.5 to 0.045. I also had the 0.5 first in the spirit of reducing waste over time.,
,,I,,,C,,6a,Attempting to keep water quality where I've been keeping while maximizing economic benefit and gradually reducing waste.,
,,I,S,,,,6b,As an environmental planner I want to gradually reduce waste and keep the water quality high.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,Prioritize Reliability and quality while maximizing benefit.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,0.1 and 0.2 hurt benefits too much. 0.5 hurt reliability and quality way too much so 0.35 was chosen as a happy medium.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,Prioritize reliability and quality while maximize benefits,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,The 0.2/0.5 example looked good in reliability and benefits but a little too harsh on quality so it was lowered to 0.045/0.2,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,Prioritize reliability and quality while maximizing benefits.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,The 0.5/0.2/0.1 example looked good but benefits were a little too low. The second interval was raised to compensate and the overall was lowered to help quality.,

,,,,,,,3b,"I used this strategy because this was all of the information provided to me. Also, there was no cost in maximizing the setting on the levers. ",
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"My strategy was to find the mid point on the scale such that both A and B would benefit equally. Higher settings made A bigger, while lower ones made B bigger.",
,,I,,,C,,4b,I chose this strategy because I wanted there to be no other optimal situation to benefit both A and B. My slider scale choice reflects what I feel is the most efficient and beneficial choice for A and B.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I used the examples to see how the sliders worked. Then, I tried to created a combination with those sliders so that both A and B benefited equally. ",

,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to maximize A and B equally without there being any better combination of scale settings. I used previous examples to see how the scales worked.,

,,,,Sd,,,8b,"I used this strategy because I wanted to see which lever controlled what, and then I would base my decision on that.

,,I,S,O,C,,3b,I used this strategy because it still achieves the goal of maximizing economic benefit while releasing slightly less waste.,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,I picked a point that provides the highest water quality for a small cost in economic benefit. ,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I used this strategy because adding any more economic benefit would greatly decrease the quality of water. This way you keep as much economic benefit you can in order to also keep the water quality high.,
,,I,S,,T,,5a,"Here, I tried to maximize the water quality while also earning some economic benefit. There is a level of economic benefit where the water quality drops very quickly. I picked the point right before the water quality drops. ",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I did this to maximize water quality while also getting as much economic benefit as possible.,
,,I,S,,T,,6a,"I noticed there is a point where, to maximize water quality, that economic benefit doesn't vary much even with highly varying levels of water quality. ",
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I used this strategy to maximize the water quality while trying to keep economic benefit as high as possible.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"My strategy was to have an equal balance of reliability, economic benefit, and water quality.",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,I chose this strategy so that the chances of algae growing are not too high and there are also reasonable levels of economic benefit and water quality. ,
,,I,S,,S,,8a,This strategy kept reliability high as well as water control since these can both permanently affect the lake. The economic benefits were lower but not too low.  ,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,I used this strategy because it seemed like the best way to keep two factors maximized while keeping the third at a level that is not too low.,
,,I,S,,S,,9a,This strategy maximizes water control and reliability while still trying to maximize economic benefit. Maximizing economic benefit is the lowest priority.,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,I used this strategy because economic benefit does not have a permanent effect on the lake whereas the other two factors do. ,
260201,a,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to bring the most economic benefits to the factory in order to benefit the workers.,
,,I,S,Am,,,1b,"With more economic benefits, the workers can make more money, and there is always a way to still clean the lake and filter the waste going in with extra money.",
,,I,S,,,,2a,Make the best situation economically for the factory.,
,,I,S,Am,,,2b,"With more money coming in, more jobs can be created/workers can bed paid more. The factory can also find ways to filter waste and keep the lake clean still if they have to.",
,,,,,,,3a,I made the waste deposited increase over time but a little more gradually.,
,,I,S,Am,,,3b,"Over time, they can figure out ways to still filter the waste/keep the lake clean while also helping the factory and people benefit from the high economic income the factory is getting. ",
,,I,S,,,,4a,Help the factory and workers make the most amount of money.,
,,I,S,,,,4b,"After a certain point the water quality was super high, but the economic benefit was very low. After this point, the water quality dropped drastically and then was on a very gradual decline. During this gradual decline, economic benefits were high. If water quality was only declining very gradually, where it was almost the same level throughout the entire change in waste deposited, it made sense to bring the factory to the highest level of economic benefit.",
,,I,S,,C,,5a,Keeping economic benefits high while paying attention to water quality.,
,,I,S,Am,S,,5b,"Water quality can only stay very high is economic benefit is very low. I found a point where water quality was pretty much staying the same no matter how much waste was released, and with high economic benefits. With high economic benefits, it can help the workers and the town, and they can find other ways to keep the lake clean.",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,Increase economic benefits as much as possible while still keeping water quality in mind.,
,,I,S,Am,S,,6b,"Water quality can only be high if economic benefit is very low, so I found where economic benefit can be high but water quality only drops at a gradual rate. With high economic benefits, it can help the workers and a town, and they can find alternative methods to keep the lake clean.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,"Trying to balance out all three factors as much as possible, with still having high economic benefits.",
,,I,,,C,,7b,"High economic benefits for the factory are important for the town, but having some good water quality could keep the lake clean for a longer amount of time. Some reliability is reassuring as well.",
,,I,S,,C,,8a,keep economic benefits as high as possible without ruining the Lake completely.,
,,I,S,,,,8b,Economic benefits are the most helpful to the town in the long run. ,
,,I,S,,,,9a,Keep economic benefits as high as possible without water quality and reliability being at 0.,
,,I,S,Am,,,9b,"Economic benefits are the best for the town, and in 100 years they can find other ways to keep the Lake clean, but without a good economy, they will barely be a town.",
260202,c,I,S,,,,1a,"I was trying to maximize A, so I could see that the bar (symbolizing the amount of A) increased as I moved the slider to the right. So I moved it all the way to the right to maximize the amount of A.",
,,I,S,,,,1b,"To get the most A possible, I experimented with the slider to see what it changed and then chose the position that represented the most ""A"".",
,,I,S,,,,2a,"I did the same thing as last time, experimenting with both sliders to see what they did and then chose the positions that maximized the amount of A",
,,I,S,,,,2b,I wanted to maximize the amount of A.,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"I did the same thing as last time, experimenting with the scales to see what they changed and then chose the positions that maximized the amount of A",
,,I,S,,,,3b,To maximize the amount of A,
,,I,,,C,,4a,"So I played with the slider a bit because I wanted a balance between A and B. However, if I chose the exact balance between A and B, you didn't get much of either. So then I looked to see if I maximized A, I barely got any B. But, if I maximized B, I got more A than I would've B if I maximized A. So that was my decision making process. ",
,,I,,,C,,4b,"I used this strategy because I was trying to get the most of A and B together, but a compromise wasn't possible. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I tried to maximize B in the first period and maximize A in the second to hopefully result in the highest amount of both of them in the end.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I was looking for a compromise between A and B to try and maximize both. ,
,,I,C,,C,,6a,"I didn't really understand this one, but I tried maxing out B in the first period and then making up for that by maxing out A in the next two ",
,,I,C,,C,,6b,I didn't know what I was doing but I tried to get the best compromise that I could,
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I tried to maximize C because that one didn't change the other two, while also trying to maintain a balance between A and B",
,,,,Sd,,,7b,because C doesn't affect the others so you can maximize it without taking away from the other two,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I tried to maximize B and C in the first part and then maximize A in the second to maintain a balance,
,,I,C,,C,,8b,I didn't really know what to do - so I'm aiming for compromise,
,,,,,C,,9a,I tried to get the ball as centralized as I could,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I wanted each of them to be as high as they could,
260203,b,I,S,,,,1a,Maximize the economic benefits of the factory,
,,I,S,,,,1b,The decision asked for was to maximize the economic benefit and didn't have any downsides to factor in from the waste generated so I just did the max benefit,
,,I,S,,,,2a,I was trying to maximize the economic benefit through the two different years.,
,,I,,O,C,,2b,Based off the example amounts it appeared that more economic benefit came from releasing waste in the first set of years than the second set so I did slightly less for the second set because it didn't seem worth it pollute the lake for only a tiny bit of benefit,
,,I,,O,C,,3a,I wanted to maximize the economic benefit but also ensure the lake doesn't become too polluted,
,,I,,O,C,,3b,Based off the examples it seemed the first set of years had the most impact on economic benefit so I set that at the highest and then the second set had the next highest benefit and so on so I did slightly less for each set of years to ensure the lake survives,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I wanted to strike a balance between water quality and economic benefit in order to provide the town with a good economy but have the lake survive,
,,I,,,T,,4b,I used this strategy because I figured it would be optimal to strike a balance between the two. There was a significant drop between .02 and .03 in water quality as well as a significant economic benefit increase so I chose a point in between to try and achieve a balance,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I wanted to maximize both water quality and economic benefits, slightly favoring economic benefits",
,,I,,,C,,5b,I felt it would allow the most profitable experience for the town. I tried to strike a good balance between the two,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I wanted to do less waste in the first set of years because that seems to affect it the most and then have higher amounts in the second set of years and then a middle ground for the third set of years,
,,I,,,C,,6b,I thought it would be a good balance between the water quality and economic benefit of the lake,
,,I,,,C,,7a,Tried to pick an amount that would balance out the three so as to not compromise on any of the three qualities,
,,I,,,C,,7b,I wanted to ensure the lake would remain useful but also bring benefits to the community,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I was trying to find a balance between the 3 aspects in order to maintain all three and keep the town running and benefiting economically,
,,I,,,C,,8b,I tried to balance out what I thought was the best way to balance the three based off the examples I tried to come up with a solution that would benefit everything,
,,I,,,C,,9a,I was trying to ensure the lake didn't become overrun with algae but also still stayed profitable for the town ,
,,,,,,,9b,I decided to try to find an example and then try to tweak it slightly hopefully to achieve a more optimal solution,
260204,d,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to make sure that A was at the highest it would be while trying to move the slider bar.,
,,I,,,,,1b,I used this strategy to help me increase the value of A,
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to use both sliders to improve the A bar/,
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy to make sure that both sliders provide an optimal solution,
,,I,S,,,,3a,I noticed that if two bars are the same and one is different it would increase A more than other ones,
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used this strategy while looking at the examples and following the same theory as the examples.,
,,I,,,,,4a,I looked at the examples to find out that I would need a low period to have a high B value,
,,I,S,,S,,4b,I used this since a high B was needed and a low A,
,,I,,,,,5a,I was trying to adjust both the sliders to an optimal level and noticed that it would happen if the first slider was lower than the second one,
,,I,,,,,5b,I used this to get a higher B,
,,,S,,,,6a,I noticed that having the same value of period 1 and 3 was ideal. But period 2 had to be lower than both 1 and 2.,
,,I,S,,S,,6b,I used this strategy to get the most out of B since A decreases B.,
,,I,,,S,,7a,I was trying to get the largest C value while having a desirable B value and a low A value. I adjusted the slider based on this.,
,,I,S,,,,7b,To get highest C value,
,,I,,D,S,,8a,I was trying to reduce A but have a high B and C. I adjusted the slider bars to an optimal level that favored this,
,,I,,D,S,,8b,I was trying to reduce A but have a high B and C since they are the most desirable.,
,,P,S,,,,9a,I used numbers that I felt were the most ideal and give the most payout,
,,I,S,,,,9b,I used this since it was giving the most C and B.,
260205,c,,,,,,1a,I was trying to fill up the orange bar all the way,
,,I,S,,,,1b,To get the higher A,
,,,,,,,2a,I was trying to fill the orange bar as high as it would go,
,,I,S,,,,2b,To get the highest A,
,,,,,,,3a,I tried to get the orange bar to go as high as possible,
,,I,S,,,,3b,To get the highest possible A,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying to get the most out of A while not completely hurting B,
,,,,,T,,4b,The drop off between a high B and low A was a lot larger than going for a higher A and high B,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,Get a high A while minimizing the damage to B,
,,I,,,T,,5b,It was easier to increase the value of A without severely decreasing B,
,,I,S,,,,6a,Get a high A ,
,,I,S,,,,6b,The decrease in B while increasing A is a lot less noticeable than if I increased B,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,Get the most out of all 3,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,I feel it was better to maximize all 3 instead of just 1,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I tried to get the highest A and B,
,,I,S,,S,,8b,I felt it was better to have a maximum value for two of them instead of a mediocre value for all 3,
,,I,,,C,,9a,Tried to maximize the value of A and B,
,,I,S,,S,,9b,It is better to have 2 values at their maximum instead of all 3 at a mediocre value,
260206,d,I,C,,,,1a,I was trying to choose the setting that maximized A by period 10. I also checked if the setting of the slider affected each period differently. I did not find that the setting level had any effect,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I wanted to maximize A by the 10th period since my goal was to generate the most A,
,,,,,,,2a,I clicked through the example strategies to see the magnitude each level had on the total A. Period 2's level seemed to have less impact so I wanted to first maximize period 1. Then I would maximize period 2. The example strategy with having each level at 10 seemed to produce the most A at the end of the two periods.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"My goal is to maximize A, and with the given example strategies, putting each level at 10 seemed like the optimal. I noticed period two had less impact on generating A though, but the there is not enough information on how much period 2 lever adds in total",
,,,,,,,3a,"Maximize total A. By clicking through example strategies, it appears period 1 has a greater effect than period 2. And period 2 has a greater effect than period 3. There is not enough information on the total amount each lever would add separately.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"Based on the given information, putting each lever at 10 appears to create the most A",
,,I,,,T,,4a,"I want to find the place where both A and B are equal because that is when there is the lowest tradeoff between A and B. I noticed the levels drop significantly between 2 and 3 so I chose a number in the middle. Hopefully it would be on a 45 degree line from the origin, representing equal A and B",
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I want to reduce the tradeoff between A and B so the point should fall on a 45 degree line.,
,,I,S,,T,,5a,I wanted to see how each level affected A or B. It appears that Lever 1 affected A more and Lever 2 affected B more. There was a point on each level where there were drastic drops towards each A or B so I wanted again to fall on a 45 degree line,
,,I,S,,,,5b,Falling on a 45 degree line reduces the tradeoff between A and B. Figuring out which lever impacted A or B allowed me to adjust each level accordingly,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,"I want to see how each level affected A and B. It appeared that 1 had a larger impact than 3 on A, and lever 2 has the most control on B. I wanted to again fall on the 45 degree line to reduce tradeoff regardless of a person's preference",
,,I,S,,,,6b,"By falling on the 45 degree line, I can reduce the tradeoff regardless of people's preference.",
,,I,,,T,,7a,"I want to see if there are areas where there is a huge tradeoff for A, B, or C. I wanted to have one that evenly distributes across the three variables",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"Evenly distributing across A, B, and C reduces tradeoff regardless of people's different preferences.",
,,I,C,,C,,8a,"I want to find a place that evenly distributed across A, B, and C. I had difficulty in determining the effect of each level on each variable",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"Evenly distributing while trying to maximize each A, B, and C would result in choice where people' preference didn't matter too much since the trade off is minimal",
,,I,C,,C,,9a,"I want find a decision that is distributed evenly across A, B , and C. It was difficult figuring out which lever affect each variable and to what magnitude. It seemed like lever 2 affected C, but it would tough to determine how A and B were affected",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,A strategy that evenly distributes reduces the trade off between the three variable and caters to most people regardless of preference,

,,,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because it seemed the most effective.,
,,,S,,,,2a,I had to decide how much waste I needed to allow for. ,
,,,,,,,2b,I used this strategy because it worked best when trying to figure out exactly how much I needed to allow for,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"The strategy that I used from 0-33 I made this the highest therefore, it had a high economic benefit. ",
,,,S,,,,3b,I used this strategy because it was the most useful to me. The other years were much less ,
,,I,,Sd,C,,4a,The higher the water quality the higher the economic benefit. I was trying to increase the water quality so that the economic benefit would increase as well. ,
,,,S,,,,4b,I used this strategy in order to solve the problem that was accounted for. ,
,,I,S,,,,5a,"As the periods increase in age, the economic benefits increase as well.",
,,I,S,Sd,,,5b,"I used this strategy because as the periods start getting bigger, the economic benefits are increasing. ",
,,I,,,,,6a,I was trying to make the water quality and economic benefits neutral. This helps when trying to explore that each period can we different at times. ,
,,I,S,,,,6b,I used this strategy because waste can increase over time and that the water quality has a correlation with this. ,
,,,S,,,,7a,"My strategy for this was taking into consideration when the dot was near the reliability line, this was higher up. In addition, when the dot was near the water supply this was a major factor. ",
,,,S,Sd,,,7b,"I used this strategy because the higher the water quality is the higher the economic benefits are. In addition, if the dot was near the reliability line then it was neutral.",
,,,S,D,,,8a,"This strategy was effective in that every time the dot was closer to the water quality, I increased the period in years. ",
,,,S,,,,8b,I used this strategy because if the arrows always point towards the higher values this explains a lot. ,
,,,S,,,,9a,"This strategy helped me a lot because everytime I made a decision, the water quality and economic benefits was what I based it on. ",
,,,S,D,,,9b,I used this strategy because it was effective and went quite smoothly. I increased the amount of years if the dot was high. ,

,,I,S,Am,C,,4b,"Some waste can removed over the years hence allowing for a consistent amount of waste to be produced.

,,I,S,Am,C,,5a,Maximize benefit overall while keeping waste removal in mind,

,,P,,,C,,8b,This strategy leads to a more balanced approach which leads to a higher payoff,
,,P,S,,C,,9a,Balance all three factors and maximize waste in earlier time periods; higher balance leads to higher payoff,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,Polluting in earlier time periods seems to lead to high economic benefit while maintaining a relatively higher rate of reliability and lower waste,
260216,a,I,S,O,C,,1a,I wanted the economic success of the company to be at least 50% without completely contaminating the water.,
,,P,S,O,C,,1b,"The measurement of my success was based off how well the factory's economic success was. Therefore I valued the production values over that of the water quality. However, being an environmental planner I chose the waste/year to be 0.075 so that it was not at is maximum and not the worst case scenario for the environment.",
,,I,S,,,,2a,My goal with this strategy was to maximize the economic benefits for the factory. ,
,,P,S,O,,,2b,"I used this strategy because my measure of success was directly correlated with the economic benefits for the factory and town.  The more production they had, the greater the economy would be, although the worse the water quality would be.",
,,I,S,O,,,3a,"My goal was the maximize the economic benefits of the factory, despite the poorer quality of water. ",
,,P,S,O,,,3b,I used this strategy because my reward is dependent on how high the economic benefits are. There is no mention of aiming for greater water quality. ,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying to find a balance between water quality an economic success in a way that economic success was greater. ,
,,P,,,,,4b,I chose this strategy because my reward is dependent on how well the change of one aspect barely affects another.  The range I picked for economic success was not making the water quality much worse as it was slightly increased. ,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I was trying to equally maximize both the economic benefits of the factory, as well as, the water quality.",
,,I,,,C,,5b,"I used this strategy because the goal was to try and make it so it was hard to improve on aspect without making the other aspect worse. In the plan I developed, economic benefits and water quality are almost equal. ",
,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to maximize water quality and economic benefits at the same time. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I chose this strategy because the water quality is decently high and the economic benefits are in a medium range. If the economic benefits were increase slightly it would greatly decrease the water quality. ,
,,,,,C,,7a,I was trying to maximize all of the aspects without having one especially low.,
,,P,S,,C,,7b,I used this strategy because I am rewarded based off how hard it is to change one aspect without making another worse. The plan I chose has all aspects relatively equal. ,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,"I was trying to maximize all of the three aspects, making sure reliability was above 50.",
,,P,S,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy because I am rewarded on how hard it is to change one aspect without making others worse.  In this scenario, all aspects are somewhat equal.",
,,,,,C,,9a,"I was trying to make all aspects somewhat equal, while also making the waste per each year span relatively equal.",
,,P,S,,C,,9b,I used this strategy cause I am rewarded on how hard it is to change one aspect without making another aspect worse.  I also wanted the reliability and economic success to be higher. ,

260218,c,I,S,,,,1a,I would move the sliding bar up to maximize A,
,,,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because it was the most effective,
,,I,S,,,,2a,I moved the sliding bars to the max so that I could maximize A,
,,,S,,,,2b,"Out of all the combinations on the sliding bar, that seemed to be the most effective",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I moved the sliding bars further up in order to maximize A,
,,,S,,,,3b,I used this strategy because it was the most effective,
,,,,,C,,4a,I was trying to get the most of each by moving the sliding bar,
,,,,,,,4b,"I used this because there was no best case scenario, so I would try to get as much as each that I could",

,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to maximize A and B,
,,,S,,,,6b,I did this because that's the goal,

,,,,,C,,8a,I tried to max out all letters this time,
,,,,,,,8b,I wanted to see how I would fair if I did that,
,,,,,C,,9a,I tried to maximize all three,
,,,S,,,,9b,Because I had more information with three sliders,
270201,d,I,S,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize A so the setting was always put at 10.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,"Since there was no extra cost, I always had A at 10.",

,,I,S,,,,2b,It did not look like using anything under a 10 setting affected the A generation.,
,,I,S,,,,3a,get a high A level so maximizing the levers,
,,I,S,,,,3b,To get the highest A possible,
,,I,,,C,,4a,I am trying to balance A and B so I used 5.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I did not want to put more importance on A over B,
,,I,S,,,,5a,"On period 1, I only focused on A and on period 2, I only focused on B.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I would optimize on A and B during their period so it is a fair compromise ,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,I equally split the time between A and B,
,,,S,,,,6b,"It looked like period 2 had more leverage on the orange dot, so I made that one 5.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,I tried to balance A with B and C.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,A lower A showed a higher B and C ,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,"I equally distributed between A, B and C",
,,,S,,C,,8b,To have a fair chance at all three,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"I equally distributed between A, B and C",
,,,S,,C,,9b,For a fair generation of each,
270202,c,I,S,,,,1a,"The instructions said to create the most A, so I put the slider to the max production setting of A",
,,I,,,,,1b,Because I wanted to maximize A,
,,I,,,,,2a,T was trying to maximize the amount of A produced,
,,I,S,,,,2b,Because it yielded the most A possible,
,,I,,,,,3a,"I was trying to create the most A possible, and each stage being maxed out on production creates the most A possible",
,,I,S,,,,3b,The goal for this task was to create the Most A possible and this is the Best way to do it.,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"2.7-2.8 was the break point, at 2.7 the dot was high on the B and as far on the A as it would go before 2.8 with production of B dropped to less than half at 2.7. The strat was to find the highest B and A, because there was no way to have a perfect in the middle. ",
,,,S,,C,,4b,Because it yielded the highest for both possible,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I was trying to make it so that I could get the dot closest to the middle, but that was not possible, so I decided to go with the highest A without sacrificing any more B than I had to ",
,,,S,,,,5b,This seems the best way to get at least the most of something produced.,
,,I,S,,T,,6a,I wanted the highest on B and A as possible and that was it. The second 2 sliders were at a perfect spot and the top one was moving the dot higher on A until it was as far as it would go before it dropped,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I wanted to find the perfect spot for A and B,
,,I,,,C,,7a,"Tried to get the dot closest to the middle line, which means the most A, B, and C possible, any other change to the slider will decrease one of the aspects",
,,,S,,,,7b,To find the most efficient plan possible,
,,,,,C,,8a,Was trying to get the dot in the middle of that plane to create the highest of all three possibilities,
,,,S,,,,8b,It seemed the best way to make it the highest possible,
,,,C,,T,,9a,"The three slider is a challenge, but the strat was to get the dot closest to the middle by fixing each of the sliders and moving them independently. once you find the break point ( the point where the dot jumps a far distance down one of the sliders, you fix it and move on)",
,,,,,,,9b,"because it seems the easiest way to do it, instead of trying to change them all at once.",
270203,a,I,,O,C,,1a,"When trying to decide my strategy, I figured that as an environmental planner it is important to consider the waste's affect on the environment; therefore I tried to find a compromise by setting the amount a little below halfway to consider the environment a bit more than the economic benefit.",
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,I considered the environment a little more than the economic benefit because the lake is important to the people who live there and the waste would affect the lake more than the economy in my eyes.,
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,"Initially I wanted to set both bars to amount to the same as my previous decision's total amount of waste. But then I realized that it had a different effect on economic benefits; therefore I set both to a similar amount in order to keep the environment in mind first, but also economic benefits as well.",
,,I,C,O,C,,2b,I used this strategy because I still wanted to put the environment a little bit ahead of the economy (as an environmental planner). Although it is a tough decision because both are very important.,
,,,,,,,3a,"For this specific decision I tried a different approach. This entailed allowing for more waste in the first period, but then less in the next two period at the same amount. This allowed for a little more economic benefit compared to the previous decisions.",
,,I,,,,,3b,I used this strategy in order to try out new ways of thinking. I valued economic benefits a little more this time because the economy is obviously important as well as the environment.,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"For this strategy, I allowed as much waste as I could without having the water quality drop too much. There is a specific point in the increase of waste/yr that dropped the water quality dramatically; therefore I kept the amount of waste less than that value. Additionally, I kept it a little bit more less than that to achieve higher water quality and only lose a little bit more economic benefits.",
,,I,S,,T,,4b,I used this strategy in order to get the benefits of both considerations. This involved considering how to achieve high water quality and some economic benefits at the same time without allowing for the water quality to drop dramatically.,
,,I,,,T,,5a,"For this strategy I decided to try to gain a little more economic benefit than last time, while at the same time keep the water quality at a higher level. This entailed testing out each value and seeing where the dramatic drop would occur.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"I used this strategy in order to focus a little more on economic benefits due to the importance of the economy, but also I kept the water quality higher due to the importance of the lake to the community.",
,,I,S,,T,,6a,I used a similar strategy in this decision to the previous decision I had to make. This entailed focusing a little more on the economy while ensuring not to drop water quality by too much. I set each period at the closest amount I could get before a dramatic decrease in water quality.,
,,I,,,C,,6b,I used this strategy to try and get the best of both worlds in terms of higher water quality and more economic benefits.,
,,I,C,,C,,7a,This strategy was a little more difficult because I had to consider three elements in terms of results. Within this decision I attempted to sustain higher reliability while have some economic benefits and higher water quality.,
,,,,,C,,7b,I used this strategy to try to designate a decent value for each of the three elements.,
,,I,C,,C,,8a,"For this decision I used a similar strategy to the previous decision by trying to fulfill the goals to a significant amount even if it's lesser on the economy side. It is difficult to balance all three elements, but I tested out varying values to see which had a positive effect on the community's lake.",
,,,S,,,,8b,I used this strategy in order to strive for the best results and consider that there are external factors that needed to be involved this round.,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"For this strategy, I decided to aim for a little more economic benefit without compromising the water quality level too much. I also needed to fulfill all three elements again and focus on all three to the best of my ability by testing out various values of water for each period.",
,,,,,C,,9b,I used this strategy in order to try to achieve the best possible outcome regarding the three main concerns.,
270204,b,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to see the maximum amount of economic benefit and the marginal benefit of increasing the waste,
,,I,S,O,,,1b,It seemed that full waste did not mean full economic benefit so there had to be a turnover point where the cost was not as great as the benefit,
,,I,S,,,,2a,"I was seeing which had a greater effect on economic benefit, the first half or the second half of the century to see which one I should use more waste in.",
,,I,S,,,,2b,"Obviously, if I was going to produce the same amount of waste, I would prefer to do it in the most economically beneficial way.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I was looking which years added the most marginal economic benefit for the same amount of waste,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"If I was going to produce the same amount of waste over the 100 years, I wanted it to be the most economical.",
,,I,S,,T,,4a,After viewing the examples it seemed that the relationship was in the shape of an L. I was looking for the maximum amount of economic benefit that would still leave the water with little waste.,
,,,,,T,,4b,I was trying to find the pattern so that I could find the optimal spot along the L curve,
,,I,S,,,,5a,It seemed that the most important years to keep the water clean was the second 50. So I limited how much waste I used in the second 50 years and maximized it as much as I could in the first 50,
,,,S,,C,,5b,I felt that the balance between the first 50 and second 50 was key to finding the optimal spot.,
,,I,S,,,,6a,"When comparing the earlier years to the later years (ie. .3, .7, .7 to .7, .7, .3) the amount of waste stayed the same but the economic benefit increased which means that putting more waste in the earlier years makes more sense",
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I wanted to increase economic benefit as much as I could but it was important not to completely forget about the water quality.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"I was looking for a way that maximized reliability most because with the unknown factor, I wanted to ensure that the water quality was never compromised.",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,The reliability factor is completely unknown and cannot be controlled so I considered it the most important,
,,,S,,,,8a,"I wanted to have a reliable plan and saw that in the earlier years, the more waste I used, the more harmful it was and the less benefit it seemed to give as in the later years. ",
,,I,C,,C,,8b,I think reliability is one of the most important factors but in this case it seemed almost impossible to get good reliability without any economic benefit.,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"I liked the look of the .1, .2, .1 but with a little less emphasis on reliability and quality and more emphasis on economic benefit",
,,,S,,,,9b,It seemed that this would be most effective and work the best,
270205,b,I,S,O,,,1a,My strategy is to slowly reduce the waste output,
,,,S,,,,1b,I figured a gradual approach is more realistic and suitable,
,,,S,O,,,2a,"Reducing the waste somewhat in the first 50, then reducing it more in the second 50.",
,,,S,O,,,2b,Gradual approach towards reducing waste,
,,,S,,,,3a,"Gradual, even reductions through each period",
,,I,S,O,,,3b,More reasonable and easier to adapt to over time while also working towards helping the environment without dramtically destroying the economy.,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"Make an effort to improve water quality, while also valuing economics over environment.",
,,I,S,,C,,4b,Priorites. Valued economic growth slightly over environmental. Plus some waste is already being removed naturally.,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"Lean towards economics over environment, but also focusing on moving towards clean water",
,,,S,,,,5b,Feasibility and adaptability,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,"Gradual recution of waste, preserving economics",
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"I value economy over environment, but also wanted to show a gradual approach to working towards the goal of clean water",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"A neutral approach, preserving some economic growth, while also reducing waste.",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"More waste is entering naturally, so our waste needed to be reduced more to maintain the lake, However, I couldn't entirely commit to water cleanliness as the factory still needs to be profitable",
,,,S,,,,8a,Gradual reduction,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"Feasibility, valuing both but also preserving the water long term",
,,,,,,,9a,Tried to make the best decision that didn't detiorate value on any metric,
,,,S,,,,9b,gradual feasioble appraoch,
270206,d,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize the amount of A. I looked at the examples and higher settings corresponded to more A.,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I wanted to maximize the amount of A because that is the goal. ,
,,I,S,,,,2a,I maximized the setting in both periods because the example that did that had the most A.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,The goal is to maximize A.,
,,I,,,,,3a,I was trying to maximize A. The example that had 10 for each setting had the most A.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,To maximize A which is the goal.,
,,I,S,,S,,4a,Through looking at the examples I saw it wasn't feasible to try and maximize both A and B because that yielded a lower amount of (A+B). I decided to just maximize A.,
,,I,S,,S,,4b,To maximize (A+B) I decided it was best to maximize just A. ,
,,I,S,,S,,5a,Based on the examples I realized that period 1 was more determinative than period 2. So once again I maximized (A+B) by maximizing A.,
,,I,S,,,,5b,To maximize (A+B) which is the goal.,
,,I,S,,S,,6a,Once again I determined that by maximizing A I would maximize (A+B). I realized that period 1 was the most determinative. I set the highest setting for each period because that example had the highest A.,
,,I,S,,,,6b,To maximize (A+B) which is the goal.,
,,I,,,,,7a,Now I am trying to maximize (A+B+C). Higher A means lower B and C. B and C are not related. So I tried to maximize (B+C).,
,,I,S,,,,7b,To maximize (A+B+C) which is the goal.,
,,I,S,,,,8a,I looked through the examples and determined that a 0 for both settings maximized (B+C) which means a higher (A+B+C).,
,,I,S,,,,8b,To maximize (A+B+C) which is the goal.,
,,I,S,,,,9a,I looked through the examples and determined that a 0 for each setting maximized (B+C). That in turn would maximize (A+B+C).,
,,I,S,,,,9b,To maximize (A+B+C) which is the goal.,
270207,c,I,,O,,,1a,I will try to make the it as a safe condition as A can be produce more optimum in that period,
,,I,S,,,,1b,it is in between of the optimum A,
,,,,,,,2a,"The first period is going to be longer as it is a starting period and trying to optimize everything at the very beginning, the second period is where everything is more stable and easy to execute.",
,,,S,,,,2b,Because it is more time efficient and at the same time desirable result can be produced.,
,,,S,O,,,3a,"The strategy is where at the very beginning, the skills are required at first and, the period is more longer to produce the optimum amount. As time comes by, the period is shorten for each stage as skills has been acquired.",
,,,S,O,,,3b,Because this decision making is depends with human behavior as well.,
,,I,S,O,C,,4a,"since we do not know which strategy that people will choose, getting on in between of A and B is a safe condition and both party will gain the same benefit. ",
,,,S,,C,,4b,because it is safer and both conditions can be received benefits by both party,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"Based on the decision making, it is better to make both in an advantage condition. In this matter, the B is higher than A. Even though if people choose A, they will still a right amount and won't be getting nothing. ",
,,,S,,C,,5b,because it benefits both parties even though another party gain more. It's one on one win. ,
,,,S,,C,,6a,"In these three stages, the period are shorter for stages yet everyone will have the same benefit. It is more stable, and everyone get the right benefits.",
,,,S,O,,,6b,because it is more feasible and bring desirable outcome for both parties. It brings more peace and harmony.,
,,,S,,C,,7a,"This is the strategy when all parties will gain benefits and it takes shorter period to do so. It is as if not everyone will have sufficient amount of times in doing everything, but at the same time try to receive good results",
,,,S,,C,,7b,Because humans need desirable result to be seen in short time and this strategy benefits all,
,,,S,,C,,8a,"This strategy to win all parties even though not everyone will get the highest amount, but everyone will get optimum amount upon the short period especially on the second stage",
,,,,,C,,8b,Because trying to win all parties and make it equal within a short period,
,,,,,C,,9a,This is because trying to optimize two parties as the only one is less benficial,
,,,,,C,,9b,trying to optimize and make it win for majority,
270208,b,I,S,,,,1a,"I wanted to achieve a high level of economic success for the town, so I created a fairly high amount of waste. It was not the maximum level of waste that could have been released.",
,,I,S,Am,,,1b,"I used this strategy because the residents in this town need economic success in order to enjoy the town around them. If residents are not economically stable, then the beauty of the lake will be overlooked by the fact that people are unhappy financially. Over a 100 year plan, I would assume that innovation and science would be able to solve more water treatment problems and issues.",
,,I,S,,,,2a,I wanted to maintain a relatively high level of economic benefits without releasing too much waste into the lake. More waste would be released in the first 50 years compared to the final 50.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"Comparing two of the option presets, each of them had a total waste of .1, split up in increments of .07 and .03. The option with the .07 amount of waste released in the first 50 years provided a much higher economic benefit compared to the option where .07 of the waste was released in the final 50 years. This made me decide to release more waste in the first 50 years.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,"I wanted to maintain a high level of economic benefit that stretched over the course of 100 years, with 3 different periods to think about. My strategy was to release more waste in the first 2 time periods compared to the final period.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I chose this strategy because the economic benefit is higher when more waste is released sooner compared to being released in the final stage of time provided. My choices gradually decreased waste over the 100 years, but still has a high rate of waste going into the lake during the first 2 time periods.",
,,I,S,,,,4a,My strategy was to find the balance where the water would be able to fend off and destroy some of the waste. I chose a smaller amount of waste release that I believed the lake could handle.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,"I noticed that by moving the waste slider present from .02 to .03, the water quality dropped significantly with a very slight change in economic benefit. I realized that somewhere between .02 and .03 is the amount of waste that the lake can handle, and I sacrificed more economic benefits in order to keep the lake maintained.",
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I tried to maximize economic benefit without sacrificing too much of the water quality. I released an equal, moderate amount in both periods.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"I chose this strategy because the amount of waste, when released equally, had a larger economic benefit. I also noticed that by keeping water quality high, there was not enough economic benefit. I chose to release a moderate amount of waste because it provided more economic benefit with a very small change in water quality compared to one of the preset options.",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,"I released .055 amounts of waste in the first 2 segments of time, followed by .025 amount of waste in the last segment of time. I wanted to find an optimal mix of water quality and economic benefit.",
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I used this strategy based on the presets provided. This option of releasing more waste in the first 2 periods provided a higher economic benefit without sacrificing too much of the water quality.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"I chose to focus more on the water quality and less on the economic benefit, as the stakes for the lake becoming obsolete were much higher.",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"I used a strategy that released less waste into the lake because of the much higher stakes that would involve the lake to be permanently unenjoyable. I wanted to make sure that the water quality was very good given our variables, provided some economic impact, and would hopefully not be impacted by other factors that could pollute the lake.",
,,I,S,,,,8a,"I chose to have more waste released in the last segment compared to the first segment, and the overall economic impact was relatively low.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy because compared to other presets, the water quality and economic impact were higher if more waste was released later. I released a small amount of waste to provide a buffer for other waste that might enter the lake.",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,My strategy was to minimize waste impact while providing some form of financial benefit. I decided to release a gradually higher amount of waste each year.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,I gradually increased the amount of waste each year so a certain level of economic development could be achieved. I released this waste in relatively small amounts to ensure that the lake could handle the waste from the factory and other places.,
270209,a,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to keep the townspeople happy economically while also being somewhat semi-conservationalist in terms to the water quality,
,,I,S,,C,,1b,I did this to balance out economic and environmental benefits,
,,I,S,Am,C,,2a,Allow the town a 50yr period to adjust and get jobs environmentally friendly post year 50. Gives time for adjustment as well as doesn't destroy the current economy,
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,"Wanted to keep people happy, and the environment clean",
,,,S,,,,3a,"Again, same plan, as gradually as possible phase out the pollution and chemical dumping as time goes on",
,,I,S,Am,,,3b,Future generations will adjust to a pro-green world and thus will be more inclined and okay to have the factory lose its importance ,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,Keep the quality of water high while keeping economic robustness as strong as possible,
,,,S,,T,,4b,It would benefit the town in the long run plus after .027 it jumps WAY lower quality so this tradeoff is not worth it,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,Keep water quality high and economic benefits as strong as possible,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,balance out environment and economic strength,

270210,c,I,S,,,,1a,I was trying to make a value of A to close to the higher price.,
,,,S,,,,1b,I chose this strategy because I wanted to get higher desirable result.,
,,,,,,,2a,I was trying to get more productive and positive result. So I tried setting 5 for the period 1 and I used setting 9.7 for period 2. ,
,,,S,,,,2b,I chose that strategy because if first period doesn't provide a good result and we can always use the higher setting for the second period to get a good result. ,
,,,S,,,,3a,I start this trial with making setting to 4 for 1st period and then 8 for 2nd period and 10 for 3rd period.,
,,,S,,,,3b,I chose this strategy this get higher desirable result with starting from the lower setting to higher setting for the last period to have the maximum chance to get the best result.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I was tried to get the higher value of A than B, so if we are getting something more for value of A we will have very less value of B.",
this person replaced A and B with economy and environment,,I,S,O,C,,4b,I chose this strategy because if we are planning on getting a higher result in something then we have to lose something in the opposite. So if we making a value of A higher helps economy but also affect the environment I would select economy.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I used the same strategy as last plan. I tried to make first period little less with the value of A and second period high with the value of A.,
,,I,,O,C,,5b,I chose this strategy so we can still make the most of the profit for economy but we tried to decrease the affect on environment.,
,,,S,,,,6a,I used the same strategy as last two plans with increasing number in each period.,
,,I,S,Am,C,,6b,I chose this strategy because if we are having a higher economy we can spend that money through new technology to clear the environment. ,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I was trying to make the value of A higher than B and C.,
,,,S,,C,,7b,I chose this strategy because when there are three aspect and you cannot have something that benefits all three aspect so you always make the best decision that benefits the most. ,
,,,,,,,8a,I was trying to use the same strategy that I used for the last plan.,
,,,S,,C,,8b,I chose this strategy because even with two period of time you still want to make the decision that benefit the most.,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,I used the same strategy as last tow plans with having a value of A higher.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,I chose this strategy because you can start with the increasing of the value of A during period 1 and while value of B is decreasing and during the period of 2 you increase the value of A to the most to get the most result possible and decrease a little during period of 3.,
270211,d,,S,,,,1a,I chose level 10 because in one of the examples it showed the space being mostly full when on level 10.,
,,,S,,,,1b,"I chose this strategy because I thought I needed to fill up the blank space as much as possible, and when looking at one of the examples level 10 filled up the black space the most. So that's why I chose level 10.",
,,,,,,,2a,I was trying to fill up as much of the blank space as possible.,
,,,S,,,,2b,"I chose to do this because that is what I thought I was suppose to do, because it didn't have any specific instructions in what to do with the blank space.",
,,,,,,,3a,I was trying to think of a way to fill up as much of the blank space as possible.,
,,,S,,,,3b,"I chose to put the first two levers at 10 and the third one at 6 because while looking at one of the examples I noticed that even though all three levers were on 10 it didn't completely fill up, but one example where the first two was at 7 and the last one at 3 it seemed a lot more full than 3 on the first lever. SO I just chose to put 10, 10, 6",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I tried to get an equal amount of both A and B.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"I chose 2.5 because I noticed that when on 2 it was high up but more on the left, and when on 3 it just fell to the floor, so I chose 2.5 to get an equal amount of both A and B.",
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to get an equal amount of both A and B,
,,,S,,C,,5b,"I chose to do this because a lot of just one causes the other to be on the low end, so I chose to equally be in the middle putting my levers on 2 and 5",
,,,,,C,,6a,I tried to be as equal as possible.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I chose this strategy because I wanted to have an equal amount of both A and B.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"Get an equal distribution of A, B, and C",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"I chose 3 because 1 and 2 seemed to close to A and 10, 5 were to close to B so I chose 3 ",
,,I,,,C,,8a,I tried to get A B and C all equally,
,,,S,,C,,8b,I chose this strategy because looking at the examples the first lever had to lower than the second one in order for it to be more pertained in the middle,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I was trying to be an equal distribution of A, B, and C",
,,,S,,,,9b,I chose this because the lower the number on the third lever the higher up the dot is and when it was on 3 7 7 if was right in the corner of the graph so I chose a lower first number  so it can be higher up,
270212,b,I,,O,,,1a,I was trying to get the greatest economic benefit with the least amount of waste released.,
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,"I used this strategy because I kept in mind the importance of the lake to the citizens, while keeping in mind the importance of having economic benefit. The citizens in the small town are very important to the economy, so keeping them happy was something I valued.",
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,"In this case, I kept in mind the importance of the beauty of the lake. I wanted the best economic benefit with the least amount of waste introduced to the lake. Additionally, with this plan, there would be more waste introduced in the more near future, and less waste introduced after a while. ",
,,I,S,Am,,,2b,"I used this strategy because I thought it was possible for us to use the lake for waste removal in the near future, but as we are doing this, come up with different waste removal alternatives, and therefore, dump less into the lake.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,"The strategy I chose was to not dump any waste into the water, while still receiving 100% of the economic benefits.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I used this strategy because, first of all, it was the one with the highest economic benefit, and second of all, there was absolutely no waste being dumped into the lake.",
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"I wanted to have the best water quality as well as the best economic benefit, but kept mostly in mind the economic benefit because in the end, that is what will keep the small town running.",
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"I used this strategy because although the lakes water quality would be greatly affected, I believed it was important to reap the most economic benefit. Another option available was to reduce the water quality to just as much as this strategy, but with a much lower economic benefit, so I believed that out of all the options, this was the most beneficial. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,"In this strategy, I tried to equalize water quality and economic benefit. ",
,,I,S,O,C,,5b,"I used this strategy because I thought that if our water quality was going to be poor, then residents would not want to live there and therefore, the economy would suffer. However, I balanced a moderate-low amount of water pollution with a moderate-low amount of economic benefit because I felt that if one was going to suffer, so should the other.",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,I wanted the most economic benefit with the least amount of waste being introduced in the last few years of the plan.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"I used this strategy because it reaped the most economic benefit with around the same amount of waste put into the lake as other plans, and it also reduced the amount of waste dumped into the lake during the last years of the plan, therefore hopefully allowing us to help bring the lake back to its usable state.",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"Reliability is very important to me, so I mainly was trying to get a balance between high reliability and high water quality, keeping in mind the importance of economic benefits, but not basing my decision on money.",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,I used this because a low reliability would put the town at a greater risk and I would rather not take the risk and endanger citizens even though the town would make a higher profit.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,"I wanted to ensure that my strategy was reliable, therefore I picked the most reliable with the best water quality and best economic benefit.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy because even though the economic benefit is low, the risk of an algae boom was too high with any other plan with a higher economic benefit. I wanted at least 2 out of the 3 values to be secure.",
,,,,,C,,9a,I tried to find the years in which more/less pollution benefitted each of the important factors.,
,,,S,,C,,9b,I used this strategy because I realized that by slightly changing my strategy based on the examples provided that there was a possibility for me to improve all three of the categories. ,
270213,b,I,S,O,,,1a,My strategy is to reduce a fair amount of the factory's waste into the lake in the beginning. ,
,,I,S,Am,,,1b,"Releasing .07 of the waste into the lake created a large amount of economic benefit to the community, but will obviously damage the lake over the long term. My strategy is to slowly reduce the amount of waste going into the lake over the years and hope the factory finds ways to become more efficient without creating all of that waste.",
,,,S,,,,2a,"My strategy is to release a large amount of waste within the first 50 year period, and gradually scale down from there for the second 50 year period.",
,,I,S,Am,,,2b,"I used this strategy because one can assume that over the course of 50 years, a company or factory will develop ways to more to achieve the same economic benefit for the community, while only producing about half of the amount of waste. ",
,,,S,,,,3a,Same strategy as the previous 2 scenarios- produce the most amount of waste in the beginning stages and then gradually reduce that amount of waste over time.,
,,I,S,Am,,,3b,This will give the factory time to develop more sustainable practices that reduce the amount of waste it uses to produce.,
,,,S,,,,4a,My strategy was to release .4 waste into the lake over the course of 99 years.,
,,I,S,O,C,,4b,"I think releasing this amount of waste would not be too overwhelming for the other life forms in the lake to die off. It should create enough economic benefit for both the community and the factory to be satisfied. Also If I recall correctly, the factory needs this water supply to run, so this plan would not damage the water quality too much as to affect the factory.",
,,,S,,C,,5a,My strategy was to release more waste in the first half then decrease that amount by almost half for the second half.,
,,I,S,Am,C,,5b,"I used this strategy because releasing .65 waste for the first 50 years will create enough economic benefit for the community to be happy. However, continuing at that rate for another 50 years could be detrimental to other life forms in the lake. So, I decided to cut the amount of waste almost in half to preserve the water quality and life of the lake. The hope is that the factory will develop more efficient practices for its production and releasing of waste into the lake.",
,,,S,,,,6a,My strategy was to reduce the amount of waste released by the factory slowly over the course of this 100 years. ,
,,I,S,Am,C,,6b,"I used this strategy for the same reasons as before. I did not want to release too much in the beginning stages as it would kill off too much of the lake's life forms and water qualities but still have a fair amount of economic benefit. Then, allow the waste-killing algae to do its job and improve the water quality of the lake again. And finally, give the factory enough time to increase its sustainability methods.",
,,,S,,C,,7a,I chose a fairly balanced strategy here that would not seek to help/harm any of the 3 aspects too much.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"I wanted to be cautious of the algae permanently taking over the lake so I did not release too much of the factory waste since there is now a natural environmental factor as well. However, hopefully this will still create enough economic benefit for the community.",
,,,S,,,,8a,My strategy was to cut the amount of waste released for the second half of the plan.,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"By releasing too much waste in the first 50 years of the plan, the risk of the algae taking over was too high so I chose to be cautious again. For the second 50 years, we would hopefully be able to reduce the factory's waste without eliminating all of its production. Thus, we hoped to keep enough economic benefit, water quality, and the appropriate amount of algae. ",
,,,S,,,,9a,My strategy was to reduce the amount of waste over time.,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"I believe that preserving the water quality and reliability of a lake in a community can be a form of economic benefit. Therefore, we focused more on the prior two aspects for this strategy.",
270214,d,I,S,,,,1a,"Since a higher setting results a higher A, which is desirable, I chose to maximize the setting.",
,,I,S,,,,1b,Higher A is desirable,
,,I,S,,,,2a,"One example showed the maximum amount of A generated with max settings on both levers. Therefore, I made the decision based on that example.",
,,I,S,,,,2b,Higher A generation is desirable,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"As period 1 and 2's setting increases, so does the generation of A.",
,,I,S,,,,3b,This tactic produces the most As.,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,It is logical that the maximum amount of people choosing A over B or vice versa is half.,
,,,S,,,,4b,It is a safe decision. ,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,There is a possibility that B may be generated more than A since plan A may not always work.,
,,,C,,,,5b,I mainly used my instinct to make this decision.,
,,,S,,C,,6a,"I believe that most people will evenly make similar decisions in the firs two periods. In addition, I believe people will set the setting to a fair minimum to avoid problems.",
,,,C,,,,6b,My decision is based on instinct.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,I made the decision based on fairness of B and A with little impact on C.,
,,I,S,,C,,7b,I made this decision since I believe C will not be generated as much as B and A combined.,
,,I,S,Sd,C,,8a,"Since A is only affected on the two stages, I applied a value of B to lower the impact of A.",
,,,S,,,,8b,The decision is based on logic.,
,,,S,,,,9a,I believe that there will be major adjustments during the second period and little adjustment on the third period to perfect the plan.,
,,,S,,,,9b,This decision is based on what I feel is appropriate.,
270215,a,I,S,O,,,1a,"The town in this hypothetical situation thrives on the success of this company, but it also values the appearance of the lake. Without financial success, the citizens of this town could care less about the lake's appearance if they do not have any reliable income. In other words, the citizens will most likely be so preoccupied searching for sources of income  that they will not have time to enjoy the lake.",
,,I,S,O,,,1b,"I used this cost-benefit strategy because I believed that it was the most valuable one for the community and our society as a whole.  In my strategy I did not go more than 50% pollution in the lake because for a town that still values the lake, it is easier to ease into situations like that rather than dumping it all at once, potentially causing an outrage.",
,,I,S,O,,,2a,"In this situation I decided to put a majority of the waste in the lake within the first year and in the following year I put fewer waste. With the disposal of this waste, the company will be able to recognize more economic benefit, and even if there is disapproval the company can improve its image in the following year by releasing less waste while still recognizing profits.",
,,I,S,O,,,2b,"I used this strategy because in the business mindsight a dollar now is better than a dollar in the future. The company will be able to have significantly more money if they were to dump most of its waste in the first year, and in subsequent years they will dump less. By dumping less in future years the business will still be successful and will have the opportunity to improve its reputation by dumping less waste.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3a,"Like I had decided in scenario 2, my strategy is to dump a majority of waste in the earlier years. By dumping most of the waste in earlier years, I was able to recognize more economic profit for the company and still cut down on the pollution in the lake in subsequent years.",
,,I,S,O,,,3b,"I used this strategy because I recognized the importance of the company's economic success. If the company hardly gets by economically in the first year, there is no guarantee for success in subsequent years. My strategy has put less focus on the community's lake and more of the success of the company, to sustain life in this town.",
,,I,S,,C,,4a,My strategy is to find a common middle point where there is still economic profit but there is still decent water quality. ,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,There is a significant drop off from 0.027 and 0.028 in the water quality with very minimal improvement for economic success. Once the balance between economic profit and water quality has dropped significantly it is important to recognize the costs and benefits of the decision. With the point in which I selected the company will be able to manage reasonable economic success all while sustaining good water quality.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"In my strategy I decided to try the particular point in which no matter where the amount of waste disposed, the water quality did not change. I did this for both periods.",
,,I,S,O,C,,5b,I executed my strategy this way because I wanted to have the highest economic profit for the company. In doing so I recognized that although water quality it is important to the town it never mentioned that they used this water source for anything other than recreational use. The town's citizens cannot enjoy the recreational use if they do not have any money and the town is poor.,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,My strategy was to find a balance between the amount of waste disposed over the years all while recognizing the economic success. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,In this strategy I wanted to find an equal balance of disposal through the years. The company could dispose of more waste as long as it does not drastically effect the water quality. If I were to decided to dispose of the waste all in period one then there is almost nothing you can do to increase the water quality in the following periods.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"I wanted to find an even middle ground where the company was able to make money, and still have a good water source.",
,,I,S,O,,,7b,"I want the company to maximize profits, and still maintain a good company image.",
,,I,S,,C,,8a,Once again I wanted to find a balance between the water quality and the company's ability to sustain its life. I found a middle ground in both sets of years.,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,In this scenario I wanted the company to find the most economic profit and still have success in subsequent years in order to maintain its life as a company.,
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"My strategy is to find the balance once again, but first to introduce minimal waste in the lake in the first year. In the second set of time I wanted to expand the companies ability.",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,I wanted the company to make money but to also remain sustainable.,
270216,c,I,S,,,,1a,"I tested each value to check how much A would be generated for the corresponding value from 0 to 10. Then I picked the value that would result in the most A generated, which ultimately was 10.",
,,,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because it was the most logical approach because some values might have given a greater value than ones above it.,
,,I,S,,,,2a,"I first tested each value of period 1 and found 10 generated the maximum amount of A. So then I checked each value of period 2, with slider 1 still on 10,to find out that 10 also generated the maximum amount.",
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy in order to cut down on time used by first testing which would give me the most A possible for each period then combining those together.,
,,,,,,,3a,"I first tried to use 10 as the maximum numbers fro all three categories because the past trials used ten as its maximum. So after I set them, I tried changing the numbers up for each period to test if I could get the last part of the bar filled. ",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I used this strategy because I already knew that using 10 as the base starters for each period would give me a lot of A, but then I started changing the period values to see if the last part of the bar could be filled.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I tried the first tried whole numbers as my values to see the slope of the graph. So once I found out that it was a curved slope, I then tried to find the point at which would maximize both A and B. I tried to think of this activity as a productions possibility curve. ",
,,I,S,,S,,4b,I used this strategy because I knew that I couldn't have both a maximum of both A and B so I decided on B to have the maximum.,
,,I,,,T,,5a,"I decided that B would be the most generated, so I focused on where the sudden drop was when testing the values of period 1. After I found my period 1 value, I tried to use the slider for period 2 to increase A while not drastically decreasing B.",
,,I,,,S,,5b,"I used this strategy because I realized that I couldn't have both A and B, so I decided on one and tried to maximum the other before it negatively impacted my first choice.",
,,I,C,,C,,6a,For this situation I truly didn't have a defined strategy. The most I tried to do was maximize B while trying to further expand A without too much of a drastic decrease in the point.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I used this strategy because I realized that I could generate a lot more B with a significant quantity of A rather than generate a lot of A with little B.,
,,I,S,,S,,7a,"Initially going into the situation I decided that I would want to have a higher B and C because a higher A would decrease both B and C, so I choose two maximums over one. ",
,,,S,,C,,7b,I used this strategy because I wanted to have two highly generated resources rather than only have one highly generated resource.,
,,,,,C,,8a,"My strategy was to have two highly generated resources, while trying to find a maximum of the third without it having a drastic decrease on my other two resources.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy because I realized that to have a high A I would have to give up B and C, but because B and C are not related I choose to produce maximum B and C.",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"My strategy was to maximize B and C, while steadily increasing A without it negatively affecting B or C.",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"I choose this strategy because A negatively affects B and C, so I choose to let those two become more generated while letting A have a smaller generated amount.",
280201,b,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits. I wanted to try and get the economic benefits as high as possible by looking at the information provided.,
,,P,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because the introduction explained that the greater the economic benefit was the greater reward I would receive. ,
,,I,,O,,,2a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits while trying to not over pollute the water. ,

,,,S,,,,4b,I took into account the water as well as economic benefits. ,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to find a balance between water quality and economic benefits.,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I used this strategy in order to find a plan that would preserve the water to a healthy standard but also make money for the small town. ,
,,I,,,C,,6a,I was trying to find a balance between economic benefits and water quality. I wanted to try and evenly distribute the waste between the 3 years so that the lake would not become over polluted.,
,,,,,,,6b,I used this strategy based off of the information provided. I tried to make an inference on the best plan for the town. ,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,I wanted to preserve the water quality as much as possible. At the same time I wanted to create an economic benefit without ruining the lake. It was important to find a balance between the 2. ,
,,,S,,,,7b,I used this strategy from looking at the information give. I was comparing the charts and sliders to try and find the best solution I could come up with. ,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"I was trying to maintain the water quality while finding an economic benefit. I didn't want to over pollute the lake, but also wanted to generate revenue for the town.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy after comparing the information provided. I was comparing the options that had an economic benefit, but that also had a decent water quality value. ",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"I was comparing the information provided and trying to find the best solution possible. I wanted to find a balance between water quality and economic benefit. Since the water quality is more important in this case, I was less worried about the economic benefit and was trying to preserve the water as much as possible. ",
,,I,,,C,,9b,"I was trying to produce some economic benefits but did not want to over pollute the lake in order to prevent the algae takeover. For this task, I was more concerned with the water quality than the economic benefit.",

280204,a,i,,o,c,,1a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits while releasing the least amount of waste into the lake as possible. I decided on a 0.43 waste/year into the lake because that also allowed for a little less than half the possible maximum economic benefits. ,
,,i,s,o,c,,1b,I used this strategy because it is important that the town continues to generate a profit but it is also important that the lake is not polluted to maximum possible levels.,
,,i,s,,,,2a,"I chose to put more waste into the lake for the first time period, and less waste in the lake for the second time period. This allowed for a higher amount of economic benefits.",
,,i,,o,c,,2b,I used this strategy with the hopes that less waste during the second time period would allow the lake to begin to heal on it own while still allowing a high economic benefit for the people of the town.,
,,i,s,,,,3a,"I chose to allow more waste during the first time period, less waste during the second time period and the least amount of waste during the third time period. This allowed for a good amount of economic benefit.",
,,i,,o,c,,3b,I used this strategy because it allowed the amount of waste per year being dumped into the lake to decrease over time while still allowing the town to receive economic benefits. By allowing less waste every time period there is hope that the pollution in the lake will begin to improve.,
,,i,s,,s,,4a,For this decision I choose to focus on the water quality instead of the economic benefits.,
,,i,s,,,,4b,I chose this strategy because since this was the only plan for the 100 year period there is less ability for the lake to decrease the amount of pollution in it since the waste/year will be the same flow rate for 100 years straight. ,
,,i,,,,,5a,For this strategy I tried to maximize the economic benefits by allowing more waste into the lake for the first time period and less waste during the second time period.,Should this be S when only 1 objective is even mentioned?
,,i,,,,,5b,"I choose this strategy because the lake can being to heal on its own if there is less waste in being discharged into the lake, which is what I tried to accomplish during the second time period.",
,,i,s,,,,6a,For this I decided to allow more waste into the lake during the first and last time periods and less waste into the lake during the second time period. This allowed for more economic benefits.,
,,I,,,,,6b,I chose this strategy because I am hoping that the lake would begin to heal during the second time period to allow waster quality to be improved before increasing the amount of pollution in the lake again. This trade off allowed for more economic benefits.,
,,i,,,,,7a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits and water quality but because there was no way to tell how much waste is being discharged per year from the nature source it was hard to focus on reliability . ,
,,i,,,,,7b,I chose this strategy because it seemed the best way to benefit the lake and the people of the town.,
,,i,,,c,,8a,I was trying to maximize water quality and economic profits over two periods of time. ,
,,i,,,,,8b,"I used this strategy because it seemed like the water quality would not be terrible given the economic benefits. But, there was a decent chance algae would take over the lake.",
,,i,,,s,,9a,I was trying to maximize water quality and economic benefits. I did not fully take reliability into account.,
,,i,,,s,,9b,I used this strategy because it allowed for high water quality given the economic benefits and I did not fully take the chance of algae taking over the lake into consideration because there was no way to fully determine that.,
280205,b,i,,o,c,,1a,I picked the option that resulted in a somewhat good production rate for the factory as well as a clean lake.,
,,i,s,o,c,,1b,It appeased to lake loving citizens and those who worry about the economy.,
,,i,s,o,,,2a,I chose a lower waste level for the first 50 years so that the Lake doesn't get too dirty and for the second 50 years I increased it.,
,,i,,am,,,2b,"People will be fine with the factory for the first 50 years because its waste level isn't too high, and hopefully by the second 50 years they wont care about increased waste cause of the benefits of the factory.",
,,,s,,,,3a,I gradually increased the waste by .02 every 33 years.,"Should this be i? If not, what about 1990?"
,,i,,am,,,3b,I did this because a gradual increase calls less attention from the public and 66-100 years from now our efficiency in terms of waste management will probably be better.,
,,i,s,,,,4a,I picked a lower waste rate.,
,,i,s,,t,,4b,"I used this strategy because at .02, the lake quality was very high. I chose this over .03 because at .03, the economy wasn't a lot better than at .02 and the lake quality was much lower.",
,,,,,,,5a,I went with low waste for the first 50 years and more for the last 50.,
,,i,s,am,,,5b,"I used this strategy because initially we don't want to disturb the lake quality and anger the citizens, so .01 ensures good quality. Then, .07 will help to better the economy during a time where there is probably better waste management and more support for the factory.",
,,,s,,,,6a,I looked at all of the examples and chose this setting from them.,Focused on examples?
,,i,s,,c,,6b,"The example provided that used these numbers showed the dot on the graph in the upper right, which means lake quality and economic quality were both very high","Once again, mentions example but goes into enough detail"
,,i,s,,,,7a,I chose a lower number to avoid overflow of waste from natural waste.,
,,i,s,,c,,7b,"I chose this because it kept the water quality good while accounting for excess waste. Additionally, the economy wasn't too bad.",
,,i,,,c,,8a,I was trying to make sure the water quality and reliability were in good positions with a somewhat productive economy.,
,,i,s,,c,,8b,The water quality and reliability were satisfactory and the economic benefits were very good.,
,,i,,,c,,9a,I was trying to have a sufficient amount of factory production while maintaining water quality and reliability,
,,i,s,,c,,9b,"This strategy produces a good economy while limiting waste, which is important to make sure that algae don't take over the lake.",
280206,d,i,s,,,,1a,"I was trying to get the most out of A, so I raised the slider bar all the way to 10.",
,,,,,,,1b,Going through the examples it seemed as if the higher the slider bar went the more you received from A.,Too focused on examples?
,,i,s,,,,2a,I was trying to make A the largest it could be so I made both sliders 10.,
,,,s,,,,2b,When looking through the examples the greatest amount of A occurred when the sliders were maxed out.,Too focused on examples?
,,i,s,,,,3a,I was trying to make A the highest I could so I made all the sliders 10.,
,,,s,,,,3b,When moving through the examples it was clear that A rose when the sliders did as well.,Too focused on examples?
,,i,,,c,,4a,I was trying to get the most A while also getting the most B so I settled in the middle trying to get equal amounts of A and B.,
,,,s,,c,,4b,When the slider was minimal it gave me all B and no A and when the slider was maxed out I had al A and little B so I settled in the middle.,
,,i,s,,c,,5a,Trying to get the most A and B so I chose the middle value for the sliders.,
,,,s,,,,5b,I used this strategy because when the sliders were high there was more a than b and the opposite for when they were low.,
,,,s,,c,,6a,I was trying to use all three sliders to get a near equal and high amount of both a and b so I moved the sliders towards the middle.,
,,,,,,,6b,The sliders seemed to give more to a at high values and more to b at low values.,
,,i,,,c,,7a,I was trying to get the most of A B and C collectively,
,,i,s,,c,,7b,I used a lower number on the slider because it benefitted both B and C well and also A some.,
,,i,,,c,,8a,I was trying to get the most a b and c just like always,
,,i,,,s,,8b,I thought more b and c was more appropriate than a lot of a and not as much b and c,
,,i,s,,c,,9a,get as much of them all as possible,
,,i,s,,s,,9b,I picked low values bc a and c responded well and made up for a lower b,
280207,c,i,s,,,,1a,I moved the slider bar from left to right slowly to see where the most amount of A was generated,This participant mentions the sliders a lot. I coded I mostly becuase they also talk about the objectives
,,,s,,,,1b,It was simple and effective,
,,i,s,,,,2a,I stared with Period 1 and moved the slider from left to right slowly to watch where the most amount of A was generated. I repeated this for Period 2.,
,,,s,,,,2b,It took minimal amounts of time and was effective in finding the best plan,
,,i,s,,,,3a,"I started with Period 1 and moved the slider from left to right to find the greatest amount of A, I repeated this for periods 2 and 3",
,,,s,,,,3b,It was quick and effective,
,,i,s,,t,,4a,I moved the slider from left to right to see where amounts of A and B were highest.  I found that it dropped off around 2.7 but it seemed like there were higher amounts of A and B combined for this location versus others ,
,,i,s,,,,4b,Slowly moving the slider let me see where amounts of A and B got really low and decide where the best spot was.,
,,i,s,,c,,5a,I started by moving Period 1 slider from left to right to see where the highest amounts of both A and B were located. This was 3.5.  I then moved Period 2 slider from left to right to see how this affected the plan.  It only ended up making amounts of A and B lesser so I kept it at 0.,
,,i,s,,c,,5b,It provided me with the highest amounts of A and B,
,,i,s,,c,,6a,I started by moving slider 1 to determine the location with the highest amount of A and B. Then I moved slider 2 to see how it affected these amounts. Then I moved slider 3 to see how it affected the amounts.  I then went back to slider 2 and moved it around again to determine the best location for it and I again did the same for slider 1.,
,,i,s,,c,,6b,I wanted to make sure I tried as many variations of each slider as possible to make sure I reached the highest amount outcomes for both A and B,
,,i,s,,s,,7a,By moving the slider I watched where the amounts were and decided upon a point that had very high amounts of B and C and a lower amount of A.,
,,i,s,,s,,7b,Even though A had a lower amount the very high amounts of both B and C should make up for the lack of amount of A.,
,,i,s,,c,,8a,"I started with the first slider to find where the highest amounts of A, B  and C was located. I them began to move slider 2 back and forth to see how it affected the amounts.  I went back and forth until I found a combination with the highest amounts of each possible.",
,,,s,,,,8b,"So I could see how different locations on the slider bar affected the amounts of A, B and C",
,,i,s,,c,,9a,"I started with the first slider bar and left it where the highest amounts of A, B and C were located. I then moved on to slider 2 and did the same process. Same with slider 3.  I then went back trough each to double check they were in the best location possible.",
,,,s,,,,9b,It allowed me to step through each slider and then go back and check my work to make sure I was making the best choice possible.,
280208,a,i,s,o,c,,1a,I used the strategy of trying to get the most economic prosperity with the least amount of waste. ,Comprimise?
,,i,s,o,c,,1b,"I used this strategy because I wanted the economy to do well, but I also wanted to put the water quality of the lake into perspective. ",Comprimise?
,,,s,,,,2a,I used a high amount in the first period and a lower amount in the second period. ,
,,i,,o,c,,2b,"I used this strategy because in the first period, the impact of the slider bar had a bigger effect than the effect of the second bar. Once again, I wanted to have a high economic prosperity without ruining the water quality too much. ",Comprimise?
,,i,s,,,,3a,"In period one, I had the most pollution of the water and then reduced it exponentially over the second and third periods. ",
,,i,s,,,,3b,"I used this strategy because each improvement of the economy decreased over the three periods, so I wanted to maximize the first period as much as I could. ",
,,i,,,c,,4a,"I tried to find a median between water quality and economic factors, but leaned towards economic factors. ",Comprimise or sacrifice? (check below this too)
,,i,,am,,,4b,"I used this strategy because I felt as though I was not polluting the water too much, but also was able to prosper economically. In addition, the thought of the algae eating some of the waste had me lean toward moving the dot towards the economic side.",
,,i,,,,,5a,I tried to maximize the economy to the best of my ability without hurting the water too much.,
,,i,,,,,5b,I used this strategy because I felt that I maximized my economic ability without moving the position of the quality of water too much. ,
,,,s,,,,6a,I played around with the slider bars to get the highest position.,
,,i,s,,,,6b,"I used this strategy because if I increased the slider bars too much, it would hurt the water more than it would help the economy. ",
,,i,,,c,,7a,I tried to maximize the water quality and the economic benefits to the best of my ability.,
,,i,,,,,7b,"In this scenario, I did not want to pollute the water too much because it is already being polluted by natural factors. ",
,,i,s,,c,,8a,My strategy was to maximize the water quality and the economic factors to the best of my ability. I put more production into the first time period compared to the second. ,
,,i,s,,,,8b,"I used this strategy because the first time period had a bigger impact than the second period. In addition, I was afraid of polluting the water too much. ",
,,i,s,,c,,9a,"I tried to maximize water quality, reliability, and economic profit. ",
,,i,s,,c,,9b,I used this strategy because I wanted to make sure that I didn't hurt one aspect more than the other. ,
280209,b,i,s,,,,1a,Figure out how much waste would be put into the lake by the end of the time period.,
,,i,,d,,,1b,"I played around with the slider to see if it would change anything and it didn't, so I just picked a lower number on the slider because you don't want a high amount of waste being put into the lake.","Was in static, but this could be D or maybe O"
,,,c,d,,,2a,"I tried moving the sliders around to see if that would change the ""economical benefits"" and nothing worked so I just picked a number and had them match for each of the time periods.",Could these be C as well?
,,,c,,,,2b,I chose this strategy because I didn't know what else to do. ,
,,i,s,o,,,3a,"I looked through the different graphs of the economical benefits and saw that putting all three at .1 would be the most beneficial  but not for the lake. I saw that around .7/.6 was also pretty beneficial, but still that seemed high to put that much waste into the lake. So I went down .1 and chose each other them to be a little lower than that graph. ",Not sure if this should be straightforward or not
,,i,s,o,,,3b,"I chose this strategy because even though putting all of them at .1 would be very economically beneficial, it wouldn't be for the lake and environment.",
,,i,s,,t,,4a,"I looked at the different graphs with the different slider portions. I saw that one extreme had high water quality and low economical benefits and the other extreme had low water quality and high economical benefits. Then I saw that .2 had high water quality and lower economical benefits, but it was enough. When the slider was moved to .3, the water quality dropped significantly.",
,,i,s,,c,,4b,"I chose this strategy because it was important to have good water quality rather than bad water quality, so I picked the highest it seemed it could be for the water to be good quality and the economical benefits to be somewhat okay.","""seemed"""
,,i,s,,c,,5a,I chose .03 for both of the sliders because it seemed to be the best placement to have the best good water quality along with the highest economic benefit rate possible.,"""seemed"""
,,i,s,,s,,5b,I chose this strategy because you want to have good water quality over the economic benefits because the water quality effects the town and will make it better for the town.,
,,i,s,,c,,6a,I put all of the sliders at .025 because it seemed to be the best placement for good water quality and decent economic benefits.,"""seemed"""
,,i,s,,,,6b,I didn't want to have to low of water quality because that would be bad for the town. ,
,,i,,,s,,7a,"I chose .02 because the water quality levels were high and so was the reliability. The economic benefit was not that good, but the other two categories mattered a little more in my opinion.",
,,i,s,,,,7b,I chose this because you want good water quality to ensure that the lake is still useable.,
,,i,s,,,,8a,I chose .02 again because this seemed to be the best fit for good water quality and for reliability.,"""seemed"""
,,i,s,,,,8b,You want good water quality in the lake so it is still useable. ,
,,i,s,,,,9a,Once again I chose .02 because it seemed the most logical to get really good water quality and reliability. ,"""seemed"""
,,i,,,s,,9b,I think it is more important to have good water quality than good economic benefits because the lake would not be useful at a certain point due to all of the pollution and algae.,
280210,c,,,,,,1a,I tried different values of A to try to figure out a pattern,A lot of vaguesness so many blanks
,,i,,,,,1b,To see how I could find the highest output for A,
,,,,,,,2a,I tried both sliders separately then together,
,,,,,,,2b,To see how they interacted alone and with each other,
,,,,,,,3a,I tried each slider alone and with the others,
,,,,,,,3b,To see how they interacted alone and with each other,
,,i,s,,,,4a,I tried it at various points in the slider to find what had the greatest outcome overall i.e the greatest A+B,
,,i,s,,c,,4b,I didn't find a way to keep A and B equal in an optimal way so I chose the way that had the max for one and still the highest possible with that the case for the other,
,,i,,,,,5a,I tried to again maximize A+B,
,,,,,,,5b,It seems to me to have the most benefit,
,,i,,,,,6a,Tried each individually then together and tried to find max A+B,
,,i,,,,,6b,See the different ways I could get the highest A+B,
,,,,,c,,7a,Tried to find highest for each of them by trying all values,
,,,,,,,7b,To find the highest overall output,
,,,,,c,,8a,Played around with both levers to try to find highest output.  Chosen one where all three are decently high,
,,,,,c,,8b,Seems to be the best for each of them,
,,,,,c,,9a,Played around to try to find when all three are pretty high,
,,,s,,c,,9b,Keeps it even but still has good outcomes for all,
280212,D,i,s,,,,1a,My strategy was to see how high I could get the A bar to fill up in each example shown. ,Could this be I as well
,,,c,,,,1b,I used this strategy because I was not given much context. The only thing I knew was that getting A as high as possible was the goal. ,
,,,,d,,,2a,"I used the same strategy as part 1, where I was attempting to get the A bar to fill up as high as possible by playing around with the period bars.",What did playing around with sliders do here?
,,,,d,,,2b,I used this strategy to see a visual of the impact of moving the bars around. ,
,,,s,,,,3a,"One this example, I realized that the bars are staying the same every round regardless of what decision is made. In this case, I used copied the example bar at the top that matched with the highest amount filled for A. ",
,,,,,,,3b,I used this strategy because my first strategy was wrong. ,
,,,s,,,,4a,"For this case, I was using the example and visual together to make my decision. I realized the example number determines where the dot is placed on the graph. My strategy was to the line the dot into the middle of the graph so I chose a number that was similar to the example.",
,,,,,c,,4b,"I used this strategy because I do not have enough information given to see the impact A and B have on each other. As a result, I choose a middle spot on the graph so they could balance each other.",
,,,s,,,,5a,I used the same strategy as before by looking at the numbers used in the example and seeing where they line up on the graph in order to find the best solution for the middle of the graph. ,
,,i,,,c,,5b,I used this strategy because I did not the result to be completely one letter. I am trying to get them into the center. ,
,,,,,,,6a,My strategy here was the same as the last two segments. I am attempting to get the dot as close to the center as possible. ,
,,i,,,c,,6b,I used this strategy because I am trying to not have the results heavily affect one letter and worsen the other.,
,,,,,,,7a,My strategy is to get the dot as close to the where the 3 arrows meet. I saw from the example that around 5 was my best chance at this strategy.,
,,i,s,,c,,7b,I used this strategy in order to plan for the highest outcomes. Moving towards where all the arrows are pointing has the most economic benefits and water quality. ,
,,i,,,,,8a,My strategy here was to get close to the center of the 3 arrows but too close seems too risky so I used the examples to find a spot close but not too close.,
,,,,,,,8b,I used this strategy to try and get the highest results without being too risky. ,
,,,,,,,9a,"In this example, I used the similar strategy as before by trying to get the dot as close as possible but not completely because wanted to eliminate the risk of high levels of B. ",
,,,,,c,,9b,I used this strategy to try and balance the three levels in order to the highest results without being too risky. ,
280213,d,I,,,,,1a,I tried to maximize A by comparing the 6 examples.,
,,,,,,,1b,"It seemed there was a positive correlation between the period 0-10 and the amount of A, meaning the higher number would show the most amount of A",
,,,S,,,,2a,I just copied the example that provided the most amount of A.,
,,,,,,,2b,Because the other examples did not really show anything that would lead me to believe that lowering one bar or the other would increase the quantity of A more than the other.,
,,I,,,,,3a,I tried to maximize A by comparing the examples,
,,,,,,,3b,"this is similar to the last question, putting all of the sliders at 10 almost completely filled A ",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I was trying to evenly distribute A and B ,
,,I,,,C,,4b,I felt like they should be equal so I picked a number in the middle hoping that it would be split more evenly. The extremities favored one or the other so the middle may favor an equal amount ,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I tried to evenly distribute A and B by seeing if the two sliders worked individually on different axes.,
,,,,,,,5b,"It seemed as though the sliders controlled either the x or y value starting with the origin at the top of B, so moving one made it go down as the numbers increased and the other moved to the right as the numbers increased",
,,,C,,C,,6a,This one was tricky to use three sliders to make them even. I tried to use the same strategy as previous but it did not make as much sense,
,,,,,,,6b,I just tried to figure out any patterns that caused the different directions,
,,I,,,C,,7a,I tried to use the examples to figure out an average amount of A B and C ,
,,I,,,C,,7b,the example showed 5 and 7 to surround the middle so I figured 6 would be a sweet spot,
,,I,,,C,,8a,both sliders needed to help maximize A B and C,
,,,,,,,8b,it felt like higher period 1 and lower period 2 may optimize the value,
,,I,C,,C,,9a,maximize A B and C but this one is really hard so I could not really find a correlation,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I sort of picked an average number in the middle it seemed to creep toward the center of each letter,
280214,c,I,,,,,1a,have the most amount of A generated as possible so I moved the slider to the highest perceived amount of A,
,,I,,,,,1b,seemed to generate the most A,
,,I,,,,,2a,I moved the sliders to generate the most amount of A possible,
,,I,,,,,2b,seemed to have the most amount of A at those levels,
,,I,,,,,3a,generate the most amount of A,
,,I,S,,,,3b,had the highest amount of A levels,
,,I,,,C,,4a,balance between A and B,
,,,,,,,4b,seemed to not affect B as much and had high level of A,
,,I,,,C,,5a,balance A and B,
,,I,S,,S,,5b,B was low with any higher level so just went with higher levels of A,

280221,a,I,S,,,,1a,I found a place where the benefits were the highest,
,,I,S,O,C,,1b,It is the first set of data so the waste won't be too bad if the benefits outweigh the cons,
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,"I made sure that the second set of years had a lower number than the first, but still was high enough so that there would be some benefit",
,,I,S,O,C,,2b,"I used this strategy because I wanted the second set of years to still  be high, but be low enough for the water to deal with the waste",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I made sure the first set of years had the greatest economic benefit and tried to make the other two lower.,
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,"I did this so the two other sets of years would still have benefit, but be able to make up for the large amount of waste accumulated in the first set",
,,I,,,C,,4a,I tried to find a place where there were benefits but the water quality wasn't too low,
,,I,S,,,,4b,To have high benefits,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I tried to find a place where the quality of water wasn't too low, but there was a high economic outcome. I also made sure the second set of years was lower than the first",
,,I,S,,,,5b,I did that so the second set of year would give the body of water time to fix itself,
,,I,,,C,,6a,"I tried to find a spot that didn't result in the quality of water to be too poor, but still have a great outcome",
,,I,S,,,,6b,To make sure the two other sets of years gave the water time to fix itself,

280222,c,I,S,O,C,,1a,I chose 8 and a half because I knew a high amount of A was desirable but I left that little bit of room for margin of error.,
,,I,S,Am,,,1b,I used this strategy because you always want to be careful and plans can change and you need to be able to be adaptable and have room for that change. ,
,,I,S,Am,,,2a,The first period I made not as desirable due to the fact that early on in a stage things are often unknown. The second period I chose a higher value because there has been time for corrections to be made to mistakes and you can run at a faster and more efficient pace and hopefully then get closer to your goal. ,
,,I,S,Am,,,2b,I used this strategy because the early stage a lot of things can go wrong and in the second stage you should be ready to go full throttle and get the job done with the correct amount of desirability. ,

,,I,S,Am,,,3b,My strategy for this was to be careful in the first period and work out all of the bugs and progress over time to where you are eventually working at capacity and getting the job done in a timely manner with minimal mistakes. ,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,I went with 2.7 because once I hit 2.8 it dropped way down towards be so when it was at 2.7 I got high B while also having moved a little bit on the A track. ,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,I used this strategy because it allowed a little mixture of both although leaning more heavily towards B. I found that once I clicked 2.8 it jumped down to low A and B and that obviously isn't desirable.,
,,I,S,,C,,5a,I put it in the middle so both A and B cam into play and it didn't lean higher one way than the other. ,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I used this strategy because I thought it might be better to satisfy both groups some rather than just one. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,My strategy was to get it to where both were more or around 60% desirable. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I did this to again satisfy both and if we can get strong desirability out of the both of them then it is in our best interest to capitalize on that rather than just one.,
,,I,,,S,,7a,I wanted to make it where two of the letters were desirable so I chose A and B since C didn't come into play as much. ,
,,I,S,,S,,7b,I did this to have to parts desirable rather than one or just a tiny bit of each. ,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I thought I would try something different and have all parts be somewhat equal to change it up to see how it would react. ,
,,I,,,C,,8b,To change it up since I had been leaning more heavily towards A and B. I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing out on another opportunity. ,
,,I,,,C,,9a,My strategy was to get as close to the meeting point of A and B as I could. ,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I wanted them to both reach close to full desirability. ,
280223,d,I,S,,,,1a,I was trying to increase the amount of A. I looked through other examples and found that one of the examples with the slider bar at 10 had the highest amount. ,
,,P,S,,,,1b,I chose to apply this strategy because I was told that I would receive a better reward with better achievements. I was totally incentive driven.,
,,I,C,,,,2a,I chose to do five on each slider. I wasn't sure what the capabilities were of my interface. If they cant both achieve ten for both sliders then I wanted the maximum for both in each section. ,
,,I,C,,,,2b,"I obviously want the highest amount of A I can achieve and putting both at 10 seems like the most reasonable thing to do but if my interface cant achieve that high maximum of work for both sections (i.e. the max amount I can use each phase is 10), then half of that each year would maximize my potential for each section.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I went back to my original plan of following the examples to increase A.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I believe that the examples are a way for us to ""view previous planners work"" and ""how it turned out for them."" Since I know that previous examples had success with their amounts, I chose to follow in their footsteps.",
,,I,,,C,,4a,"I am trying to get a good balance of A and B because they are both desirable. Because of this, I set my amount in the middle.",
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I chose to implement this strategy to best fit the needs of consumers. The instructions indicate that both are desirable and different people have preferences to both. So I chose to put my slider in the middle to best fit the needs of both customers.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I was trying to get a good mix of both A and B. When both sliders were high, it was towards A and vice versa with B. Because of this, I chose to put my sliders both in the middle to again, make both types of customers happy.",
,,I,,,C,,5b,I chose to use this strategy to make the highest amount of customers (with opposing preferences) happy.,
,,,,,,,6a,"I chose some different numbers than the average this time. When I went through the examples, again, I saw that high numbers led to A and low numbers led to B. I also saw that when the top number was 3 and the bottom two were 7, the slider was farther left than when the bottom slider was 3 and the top two were 7. ",
,,I,,,C,,6b,"I chose to have the top slider lower to bring it towards B, the middle slider around 5 to balance it out towards A and the third slider in the middle to just cancel out so that A and B can stay in equilibrium.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I chose to have as high of B as I could, while keeping a balance between A and C",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"Because A is associated with a lower C, I had to keep them in balance. B is unrelated though so I could have that as high as it could go",
,,I,S,D,,,8a,"I chose to get the yellow dot closest to the origin as possible, leaning closer towards B if possible.",
,,I,S,,,,8b,"B is unrelated from C, so it can be High but A lowers C so those two have to be in close balance.",
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I chose again to try to balance A and C, while having a high B.",
,,I,,,C,,9b,I chose this strategy to try to increase the amount of all three without any of them having to sacrifice anything.,
280224,b,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits by looking at the examples on how much waste each one would give. ,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I saw the example that .1/yr was the must optimal for economic benefits. ,
,,P,,,,,2a,Again I was trying to maximize economic benefits as that is what the reward will be at the end of the study. ,
,,P,,,,,2b,I used this strategy because I want the most amount of reward at the end of the study. ,
,,P,,,,,3a,I am still aiming to get as much economic benefits as possible as this is what determines how much I make at the end of the study. ,
,,P,,,,,3b,I used this strategy because I want to maximize economic benefits to get higher payment. ,
,,,,,,,4a,I was trying to find an example that created the most area on the graph to maximize efficiency. ,
,,,S,,,,4b,I used this strategy because when drawing a rectangle the most area underneath it will be most efficient. ,
,,,,,,,5a,I was still trying to maximize area when drawn a line from x-axis to point and y-axis to point by looking at the examples. ,
,,,S,,,,5b,I used this strategy because it looked most logical to me. ,
,,,,,,,6a,"Once again, I was trying to maximize the area on the graph by looking at the examples. ",
,,,,,,,6b,I used this strategy because this was the most logical and only tool I could use to judge. ,
,,,,,,,7a,I was trying to minimize the distance from the point to where the arrows where to maximize the combination of the three variables. ,
,,,S,,,,7b,This seemed like the most logical solution in attempt to achieve the goal. ,
,,,,,,,8a,Was trying to get the max(sum of three variables) by looking at examples. ,
,,,S,,,,8b,Most logical and seems like the only way to approach this problem. ,
,,,,O,,,9a,I was trying to get the most grey dots closest to the end of the arrows ,
,,,,,,,9b,I used this strategy because I was trying to get the most amount of points without lessening the other variables. ,
280225,d,I,,,,,1a,Trying to get the most generated for bar A. ,
,,,S,,,,1b,Its the most optimal. ,
,,I,,,,,2a,Trying to gain the most generated for A.. ,
,,I,S,,,,2b,"In order to gain the most generated for A, period 1 & 2 have to be set at the highest (10).",
,,I,,,,,3a,Trying to receive the most generated for A in all three periods. ,
,,I,S,,,,3b,"In order to gain the most for period 1, 2, & 3. All three periods had to be set at the highest level (10).",
,,I,,,C,,4a,Trying to achieve highest efficiency for A without effecting results of B. ,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"In order to gain the highest amount of A, without effecting B. I chose to split it down the middle. Therefore, both A & B are at optimal stages. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,"Trying to receive the most optimal points for A & B, without effecting B. ",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"To reach optimal points, the setting of periods 1 & 2 cannot be set + or - 5. 5 is the most optimal point for A & B, in period 1 & 2. ",
,,,,,,,6a,Tring to receive optimal points for all three periods. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"In order to receive optimal points for A in all three parts, without diminishing B. I had to go with this strategy (5 set in all three periods). ",
,,I,,,C,,7a,Gain the highest optimal rate for A without diminishing B & C.,
,,I,S,Sd,C,,7b,"Since A is the common factor of B & C, and B & C aren't related. To reach optimum rate, 5 is the best setting for A, B, & C. ",
,,,,,,,8a,Trying to reach optimal points for all periods. ,
,,,S,Sd,C,,8b,"Since A is the common factor of B & C, 5 is the best setting for A's optimal point without effecting B & C. ",
,,I,,,C,,9a,Trying to receive the most optimal rate without diminishing the value of B & C. ,
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"To gain optimal point without effecting B & C, 5 is the best setting for all. ",
280226,a,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to figure out where was a good point that would maximize economic benefits without dumping so much waste into the lake. ,
,,I,,O,C,,1b,"I chose this strategy because I felt this was the maximal level of waste that could be dumped into the lake while still making a profit. If I would have went any higher on the economic benefit, there would be more than half of the waste left in the lake. Anything lower than the economic benefit I chose would be pointless because though there would not be as much waste, there would not be an economic benefit",
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,"My strategy was though there is a lot of waste being put into the lake at first, it amps down in the next 50 years while still getting economic benefits. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,I chose this strategy because the first 0-49 years is more vital than the second 50 because that would be the start of the business. The business would need to pass their breakeven point,
,,I,S,,,,3a,What I was trying to do was get the business to take off at first so that it had revenue to fall back on in the years to come.,
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,I chose this strategy because it received the highest economic benefit without dumping a ton of waste into the lake in the long run,
,,I,S,,,,4a,This strategy allowed the water level to still stay at a good amount before plummeting.,
,,I,S,,T,,4b,I chose this strategy because this is the last possible point where the water level will stay good and receive some economic benefit. Moving the cursor one tenth drops the water level significantly while decreasing the water level.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to keep the water quality at the highest I could while still keeping an economic benefit.,
,,I,,,C,,5b,I chose this strategy because I felt that still allowed the factory to function while still maintain the water quality.,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,My strategy here was to keep the factory still maintaining water levels while being able to reap economic benefits.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"I chose this strategy because I have learned that regardless of what happens, the water quality is going to decrease. As a result, this still has a better water quality than other options and receives a good economic benefit",
,,I,,,C,,7a,I was trying to get high water quality and economic benefits ,
,,I,S,,,,7b,I chose this strategy because it did not dump as much waste into the lake and still had high enjoy ability. ,
,,I,,,C,,8a,I was trying to keep the water quality higher than the economic benefits because the lake will be used for enjoyment.,
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"I chose this strategy because if the lake will be used for enjoyment, it will receive the monetary value it loses in the economic benefit. ",
,,I,,,C,,9a,I was trying to get high reliability and water quality. ,
,,I,,,C,,9b,I was trying to maximize both ,
280227,b,I,,O,,,1a,I was trying to have the most economic success while not releasing a lot of waste.,
,,I,S,O,,,1b,"I used this strategy because economic success is very important to help the town flourish, and maintaining the integrity of the lake will to",
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to maximize economic benefits while not releasing so much waste.,
,,,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy because it helps everyone in the end,
,,I,,O,,,3a,I tried to pick a plan that did not release a lot of waste at first.,
,,I,S,O,,,3b,"I used this strategy because I figured people in the community would be really mad if a lot of waste was dumped to begin with, and this also gives engineers time to think of a way to reduce waste. Also, they don't know how well the factory will even do or if it will still be in business for 100 years, so why compromise the lake?",
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"I think controlling waste quality is the priority, so I tried to pick a plan that had some economic benefits, but the majority of benefits placed on water quality.",
,,I,S,O,C,,4b,"Poor water quality has many more effects on a community than just what was listed. Animals can die, nature can be destroyed, and people can become sick. Some economic benefit is great, but not enough to compromise water quality.",
,,I,S,,,,5a,"Out of the options given, this option made the most sense because water quality was maintained and there was some economic benefit.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,"A lot of the other examples drastically diminished water quality for not that much economic benefit. I think that water quality is most important, so I picked a high quality of water that still had some economic benefits.",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,My strategy was to maintain integrity of water quality while still having as much economic benefit as possible.,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"I used this strategy because poor water quality can have many adverse effects, so I placed priority on water quality. I tried to pick an option with the best water quality that still had some economic benefit.",
,,I,S,,S,,7a,Maximize water quality,
,,I,S,,,,7b,Not maintaining water quality has many adverse effects to the community.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,Maximizing water quality while still having some economical benefit,
,,I,S,,,,8b,"Maintaining water quality is important to the community, as bad water has many negative effects",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,Maximize water quality while still having some economic benefit ,
,,I,S,,,,9b,Poor water would hurt the community more than a poorly working out factory,
280228,c,,S,,,,1a,I move all the bar up as much as possible,
,,I,S,,,,1b,I wanted to increase A as much as possible because that is my goal,
,,I,S,,,,2a,I move A to the highest level on both 1 & 2,
,,,S,O,,,2b,It said there were no cost to move it as high as possible so that's what I did,
,,,S,,,,3a,I move all three bars as high as they can go,
,,,S,O,,,3b,It once again said there were no cost to me do move it as high as possible so that's what I  did,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,I tried to make sure that neither A or B were put in  a really bad position so tried to put the dot in a location that I thought was fair,
,,,S,,T,,4b,There was a huge jump from 3 -4 and it Put in a really bad position around 3 so I picked 4 in attempt to be fair,
,,,,,C,,5a,"I tried to move the dot so it was ""equally"" as far from each numbers ideal spot",
,,,,,C,,5b,Since both number are ideal I knew I did want make one way worse off then the other,
,,I,C,,S,,6a,I found it hard to make find a good in between so I just mad A as high as possible,
,,I,S,,S,,6b,"Even though some people would prefer b, I preferred A and therefore made it as high as possible",
,,I,S,,C,,7a,Since B & C are both desirable and not related I kept those as high as possible but did not want to leave A at zero so I move the bar a little bit,
,,I,,,,,7b,I was trying to make as many people happy since B&C could both be high without affecting each other,
,,I,S,,T,,8a,I pushed the bar as far as I could before the big drop in B&C,
,,I,,,C,,8b,"I wanted to keep B&C  both high but I wanted A to move past ""zero"" as well ",
,,,,,C,,9a,I put the dot in a location where I thought all the numbers could benefit at least a little bit,
,,I,,,,,9b,B&C could both be high without affecting each other so at least 2/3 of people would be happy,
280229,c,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to produce the highest amount of A because that was the most desirable amount. ,
,,,S,,,,1b,"I used this strategy because it appeared most efficient, accurate, and correct.",
,,I,,,,,2a,"Once again, I was aiming to generate the most amount of A because that is the desirable amount. ",
,,I,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy because I wanted the planning period to produce the most successful and effective outcome (high amount of A generated).,
,,,S,,,,3a,"Since the first slider affects slider 2 and slider 2 affects slider 3, I wanted to divide up the work equally so that the final production was the greatest. Therefore, since 10 doesn't divide into 3 parts equally, I had each slider generate 3.3 equaling out to 9.9",
,,I,S,,,,3b,"I used this strategy so that the final product was generating the greatest amount of A. Slider 1 was generating 3.3 and then I had slider 2 generate double at 6.6, then slider 3 generated triple at 9.9 since one is affecting the other and it is a plan implemented over time.",
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"Since high amounts of A and B are desirable, I thought it would be measurable to equate them and have neither A or B higher then the other.",
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I used this strategy because a higher A is equal to a lower B and what is the point of generating a higher A and risking an undesirable lower B. I would rather equate them and have a semi-desirable outcome.,
,,I,S,Sd,S,,5a,"Although the numbers are low, the plan never said that a higher B is associated with a lower A; it just said that a higher A is associated with a lower B. Therefore, I generated the highest level of B and little to no levels of A.",
,,I,S,,S,,5b,"I used this strategy because it all comes down to producing a desirable outcome. If a high A is desirable and a high B is desirable BUT a high A is correlated with a  low B, then I will generate higher levels of B to produce that desirable outcome and not risk having zero desirable outcome.",
,,I,S,,C,,6a,"I attempted to create a strategy that would potentially produce equally balanced results in the end. Although I would like to generate higher levels of B, I created the plan so that half of A was generated in period 1 of what was generated of B in period 2 and then generated 50% of period to in period 3.",
,,I,S,Sd,,,6b,"I used this strategy to reach desirability in the end. If I can't have a high A without having a high B, but a high A is just as desirable than a high B, then I need to divide and split what is high and what is low. I produced 2 planning periods with a generated A at 5 and 1 planning period with a generated B at 10 because the higher B is worth more than the A's.",
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I wanted to generate levels of B, C, and A that were somewhat desirable and beneficial. Since high levels of A are correlated with low levels of B and C, I wanted to avoid high levels of A and generate moderate to high levels of B or C. ",
,,I,S,,C,,7b,"I used this strategy because with 3 components involved, it's about risking 1 to achieve a desirable outcome based on the other 2 that can do that. Generating low, moderate, or high levels of B or C, will generate low, moderate, or high levels of A, B, and C, versus generating high levels of A which will only generate high levels of A and generate low levels of B and C, which is counteractive. ",
,,I,,Sd,C,,8a,"Here, I wanted to generate high levels of B and A and lower levels of C. Since B and C have no affect on A or on each other, but A affects B and C; I thought that generating high levels of B and A may cancel each other out leaving low levels of C that would still contribute to B and A.",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,"I used this strategy because the affect A has on B and C is strong and if i want a desirable outcome, I would rather compromise 1 component than compromising 2.",
,,I,S,,C,,9a,"I wanted to generate B at the highest, A at the second highest, and C at the lowest. If B is high and desirable and has no affect on A or C, than low levels of C generated can still reach desirability.",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"Because as long as two out of the three desirable outcomes are achieved, I want the risk to be as minimal as possible and having generated high amounts of A would have been detrimental to B and C rather than having high amounts of B, low amounts of C, and high amounts of A.",
280230,d,I,,,,,1a,I was trying to get the most amount of A,
,,I,S,,,,1b,"The instructions indicated that we wanted a lot of A. Therefore, looking at the examples the further I slide the bar the more A would produce. ",
,,I,,,,,2a,I was trying to produce the most amount of A in both period 1 and 2.,
,,I,S,,,,2b,Based on the exampled if you raised the bar to 10 it would produce the most A/,
,,I,,,,,3a,Trying to produce the most A in each period,
,,I,S,,,,3b,The example showed that when they were all at 10 the most A would be produced.,
,,I,,,C,,4a,Trying to produce the most about of A and B,
,,I,S,,S,,4b,I chose to focus on making B higher than A because B does not effect A. While if I focused on A it would effect B. ,
,,I,,,C,,5a,Trying to get the most A and B in both periods.,
,,,S,,C,,5b,I chose to do less in period one and more in period two because it tended to keep things in the middle and balanced.,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,Produce the most amount of A and B in all three periods,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,I chose to keep period 1 and 3 at 0 and only move period 2 farther because based on the examples that appeared to keep B and A high.,
,,I,S,,C,,7a,"High outputs of A,B,and C",
,,,S,,C,,7b,I chose to keep it at 5 because based on the example that seemed to keep everything generally in the middle.,
,,I,,,C,,8a,"Try to have A,B, and C all high",
,,I,S,,C,,8b,I chose this option because although A was low A effects the other outputs and B and C stayed high,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"Try to get A, B, and C all high",
,,I,S,,C,,9b,"I chose the strategy I picked because it tended to keep all the dots evenly spaced out implying that A,B,and C get similar outcomes",
280231,a,I,,O,C,,1a,I was trying to do a 50/50 strategy with the waste and benefit,
,,,S,O,C,,1b,I used this strategy because 50/50 is a compromise when making decisions ,
,,I,S,O,C,,2a,I was again trying to do a 50/50 compromise but wanted to try and increase the economic growth so I increased the waste for the first year and less for the second,
,,I,S,O,,,2b,I used this strategy because the environment can recover the second year with using less waste from the first ,
,,I,S,,,,3a,I gradually decreased the amount of waste as years went on. So the first one had the most waste and the last had the least,
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used this because increasing the waste the first year made a larger impact for the economic growth versus the last period of years,
,,I,C,,S,,4a,This one was harder because the jump from good water quality to bad was very quick and there was not much economic benefit so I increased the economic benefit even though the water quality was low,
,,I,S,,,,4b,I used this because realistically people aren't going to care about the lake if there is no economic growth,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I tried to find a 50/50 compromise on this one as well but was more difficult since the water quality was bad at a low number so I decreased to water quality more than I wanted to but the economic growth still wasn't high,
,,,S,,,,5b,I did this because they would both be enjoyed a little,
,,I,S,,T,,6a,I picked how much waste should be disposed depending on when there was a big jump in water quality,
,,I,S,,,,6b,I used this strategy because the economic growth was increasing slowly but water quality decreased quickly and people can enjoy one aspect of their life,
,,I,,,T,,7a,I tried to pick before the jump in water quality decreased,
,,I,S,,,,7b,I used this strategy because if the water quality decreases too much than it can not be repaired.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,"For this one, I went back to my 50/50 compromise of trying to have okay water pollution but also economic growth",
,,,S,,C,,8b,I used this compromise as a strategy because this way both a re compromised but not significantly,
,,I,,,C,,9a,I tried to keep all three around the same amount of waste so the waste would gradually go into the lake,
,,,S,,C,,9b,I used this because the first period of years wouldn't have a significant amount of waste and the last not a lot. This also seemed to keep all three variables high rather than only one,

280233,b,I,S,O,C,,1a,"I wanted to increase economic value since that is important in keeping the town. However, I also wanted to make sure we weren't going to ruin the lake. I feel as though the amount of years I allotted would allow us to make as much money as possible without ruining the lake.",
,,I,,O,C,,1b,"I wanted to make as much money as possible without destroying the lake. After looking at the examples, I feel the number I selected is right.",
,,I,,O,C,,2a,I had the same strategy as I did before. I wanted to get as much money as possible while keeping the environment in mind. I was trying to find a good balance between money and the environment.,
,,I,,O,C,,2b,I feel as though this strategy allows me to be careful of how much waste goes into the lake while still being profitable. ,
,,I,C,,C,,3a,"As before, I wanted to make sure the city was profitable without ruining the lake. As there become more decisions to make, I am truthfully becoming more confused on what each value means.",
,,I,S,O,C,,3b,I used this strategy thinking it allows the town to make money while caring for the environment. ,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"I understand that we cannot release too much waste into the lake, so I decided to go with a strategy that is more conservative. I feel it is not worth the risk of ruining the lake to make more money, so I stuck to a lower number. ",
,,I,S,,,,4b,"As I said above, I went with this strategy because I feel it is the best in the long term. We are still making money, but we are not ruining the lake. ",
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"I didn't want to ruin the lake, but I also wanted to make money. I chose a plan that was a balance of the two since I feel they are both really important.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I chose this strategy because it allowed the town to make money while saving the lake. ,
,,I,S,,C,,6a,"After looking at the examples for these ones, the water was almost always at a low quality unless you chose to basically do nothing for the economy. Because of this, I decided to put all of the years at a relatively low rate, but not as low as the examples had to have high water quality.",
,,I,S,,S,,6b,"I chose this strategy because it kept the water cleaner. I feel as though this is not the best economic decision, but it will be in the long run. ",
,,I,C,,,,7a,"This three way chart was a little confusing. However, I understood that the risk of making more money meant the water was most likely going to become dirty and not be able to be used. Because of this, I kept the number small.",
,,I,S,,,,7b,I used this strategy because I do not want the lake to be permanently unusable. That is bad in the long run. ,
,,I,S,,S,,8a,"My strategy is becoming more closely related to the algae not taking over the lake. I am considering the economic value, but I feel as though I am weighing the algae more. ",
,,I,S,,S,,8b,This is my strategy because I don't want the algae to take over the lake! This would be really bad in the long run. ,
,,I,C,,S,,9a,"My strategy was to be really conservative. As I said before, I am a little confused on this whole thing and what is good on the graph versus what is bad. However, at this point, I am focusing on saving the lake rather than the money. If the lake isn't there, then people won't want to live/ visit here so there will be no point of having all this money.",
,,,S,,,,9b,"As I said before, I chose this strategy because I feel it'll be best for the long run. I have stuck to this throughout the whole experiment. ",
280234,d,I,S,,,,1a,my strategy was to get the most A.,
,,I,,,,,1b,I used this strategy because getting the most A is what was described as desirable.,
,,,S,,,,2a,my strategy was to make the most in the shortest amount of time but to advance over time.,
,,,S,,,,2b,I used this strategy with the hope to grow over time and be able to make more from period to period.,
,,I,C,,,,3a,at this point I am second guessing what the point of this study even is. I am under the impression that the most a is the best so in this scenario I did that.,
,,I,,,,,3b,I did that because the more a the more desirable ,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,in this case I was trying to have the most a and the most b knowing that they are both desirable and that more a is associated with more b. I did this by choosing the option that had the most b for the most amount of a.,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,I did this because a was the priority and however much b I could get for a lot of a seems like the most desirable option.,
,,I,,,C,,5a,I was trying to get a high b during the first period and then a high a during the second period,
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I did this because I think that this way the a and b are advancing at the same pace,
,,,S,,C,,6a,I did them all in the middle with the hope that they would advance at the same pace,
,,I,S,,C,,6b,"the lower the numbers the higher the b, and the higher the numbers the higher the a, so I decided to stay in the middle to balance them out",
,,,C,,,,7a,I do not know what I am doing,
,,,C,,,,7b,I chose a random number because I am confused,
,,,,,C,,8a,I was trying to get all of them the highest as possible,
,,,C,,,,8b,because I think that is what I am supposed to do,
,,,,,C,,9a,again I just tried to have them be equal,
,,,,,,,9b,this is the only strategy that I have,
280235,c,I,S,,,,1a,"I was trying to get the most A as possible, so I moved the slider up to the highest point (10) so that I would obtain the most A.",
,,I,S,,,,1b,"I figured 10 would be considered the ""most A possible"" and 0 would be the least. ",
,,I,S,,,,2a,I set both sliders of Period 1 and Period 2 to 10 to obtain as much A as possible. ,
,,I,S,,,,2b,I was able to achieve the maximum amount of A by moving the sliders to 10. ,
,,I,S,,,,3a,"Periods 1,2 and 3 only accounted for a ""third"" of A each, so I slid each period to 10 in order to get the most amount of A possible. ",
,,I,S,,,,3b,This strategy allowed be to obtain the most A. ,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,"I tried to get as close as possible to a balance between A and B, but I ended up favoring A. ",
,,I,,Sd,S,,4b,"I wanted to obtain either A or B, so I randomly chose to go with more of A, but it would have been the same vice versa. ",
,,I,,,C,,5a,"I tried to balance between A and B, since they are both desirable. ",
,,,,,C,,5b,I toggled with the sliders for awhile to try and get the perfect balance. ,
,,I,S,,S,,6a,I tried to maximize A. I moved all 3 sliders to 10 to get as much A as possible. ,
,,I,,,S,,6b,I wanted to obtain as much A as possible. ,
,,I,,,C,,7a,"I tried to get as much A, B, and C as possible so I tried to find the meeting point of each. ",
,,,,,C,,7b,I wanted to get as much of each as possible. ,
,,,,,C,,8a,I tried to get the dot as close to the point where each line meets. ,
,,,,,C,,8b,I wanted this to balance the amount of each. ,
,,I,,,C,,9a,"I tried to get the dot to the meeting point of A, B, and C.",
,,,,,C,,9b,I wanted equal amounts of each. ,
280236,b,I,,,,,1a,Try to only create enough waste in order to produce enough for the economy,
,,I,,,,,1b,Try to create economic benefit with little waste,
,,I,S,,,,2a,Create a moderate amount of economic benefit and waste,
,,I,S,O,,,2b,"Deal with less waste for the first 50 years so the lake will still be clean, and have more of the waste happen in the future, because maybe then they will have a better solution",
,,I,,,,,3a,Trying to get the most benefit without destroying the lake as much in the first 60 years,
,,I,S,,,,3b,Reduce the waste as much as possible in the early years so the lake can be enjoyed now and worried about later,
,,I,S,,C,,4a,Balance the waste and economic quality,
,,I,S,,C,,4b,"By balancing the waste and economic quality, both parties will be satisfied because they are both at a moderate level",
,,I,S,,C,,5a,"Keep the waste in the lake deposited equally over time, while balancing the economic decision",
,,I,,,,,5b,"Trying not to deposit waste into the lake too fast, or it will be in enjoyable",
,,I,S,,S,,6a,raise the economic benefits even though it lowers the lake quality,
,,I,S,O,,,6b,"Despite less waste into the lake in the earlier years, hoping that after 60 years there may be a new way to keep the lake clean",
,,I,S,,,,7a,keep the water quality high and clean enough for people to enjoy,
,,I,S,,,,7b,"Although the economic benefits are important, if the lake gets taken over, it will never be able to be enjoyable",
,,I,S,,C,,8a,Keeping the lake and economic quality equal,
,,I,S,,,,8b,"keep everyone happy with their job and not have the lake taken over by the algae, since we do not know how much is deposited naturally",
,,I,S,,,,9a,Slowly deposit the waste over the years,
,,I,S,,,,9b,deposit waste slowly so the economy can still run but keep the lake clean enough for people to enjoy,
280237,d,,S,,,,1a,I based my decisions on the bar graphs,
,,,,,,,1b,I thought it was logical ,
,,,S,,,,2a,My decision was based on the range of the bars,
,,,,,,,2b,I thought it was logical ,
,,,S,,,,3a,Based on the range of the bar,
,,,,,,,3b,I thought it was logical,
,,,S,,,,4a,Based on the graph,
,,,,,,,4b,I thought it was logical,
,,,S,,,,5a,I made decisions based on how high or low each point was on the graph,
,,,,,,,5b,"The higher the number, the higher the decision",
,,,S,,,,6a,I made decisions based on how high or low each point was on the graph,
,,,,,,,6b,"The greater the number, the greater the decision",
,,,S,,,,7a,I added all the numbers and divided it by 6,
,,,,,,,7b,I thought it was logical,
,,,S,,,,8a,I added all the numbers and divided it by 6,
,,,,,,,8b,I thought it was logical,
,,,S,,,,9a,I added all the numbers and divided it by 6,
,,,,,,,9b,I thought it was logical,
lpp5039,d,I,,,,,1a,"I slid the slider along the path to see how it affected the outcome of A. Then I saw that the higher the slider was, the higher A was.",
,,,S,,,,1b,I used this strategy because it's the only interaction I had with the user interface.,
,,,,,,,2a,I first interacted with each slider individually to see how they affected A and if they in turn affected each other. I then saw that both acted independently and added together to fill up A.,
,,,,,,,2b,"I tried the 3 different variations of interactions between the 2 sliders. Both alone, and then both together.",
,,I,S,,,,3a,I took the same approach as with the 2nd plan. With 3 sliders I found out their correlation with A and their effects on it. Then I noticed the 3 sliders acted independently to increase A.,
,,I,S,,,,3b,I used this strategy because it was the fastest way to figure out the different variations of A.,
,,I,S,,T,,4a,"I slid the single slider across taking note how much of both B and A there were. Then I noted that there was a sharp decline in B as I increased A after 2.7. With larger increases in A, it lowered B so I decided to stick to 2.7",
,,,,,C,,4b,It was my attempt at maximizing one while not trying to minimize the other.,
,,I,S,,T,,5a,"I tried to find the point at which increasing the slider for both results will create a dramatic dip in the quality of either A or B. First for the first slider, then for the second slider. Afterwards I slightly adjusted the first slider to try and find the dip again.",
,,I,S,,C,,5b,I used this strategy because it was finding a balance between quality of both A and B,
,,I,S,,,,6a,I first adjusted the 1st slider along to see the curve it ran along A and B. Then I did the same with the 2nd and 3rd sliders. Then I found the point at which increasing A lowered B more for each slider. I then tweaked each setting to find the minute differences between each decimal point for each slider and found the result that created the best result.,
,,,,,,,6b,Since the sliders affected the line differently depending on the other sliders. I had to toy around with each option as much as possible to see the minute differences between each value.,
,,I,S,,S,,7a,I took note a which points in the slider favored each option with the lower part of the slider favoring B and C while having low A. The upper portion of the slider had both low B and C with a high A. Since having 2 higher options while lacking in 1 is better than having 1 high option and 2 low options.,
,,,S,,,,7b,I used this strategy because it's better to be proficient in more options.,
,,I,S,,C,,8a,I was trying to maximize A while keeping both B and C high. This was done with finding the point at which increasing A lowers B and C more. I then tweaked the 2nd slider to fulfill the same strategy.,
,,,S,,,,8b,This strategy was the best at finding the point at which the magnitude of the distance to the point was the highest.,
,,I,S,,,,9a,I tweaked the first slider to find the point at which increasing A will lower B and C by much more. Then I tweaked the second and third slider to do the same. Then I tweaked the 2nd and 3rd slider to the optimal points separately and then together in different orders to find if changing them separately at different values mattered.,
,,,S,,,,9b,I used this strategy because it was the best at finding the minute differences between each option.,
